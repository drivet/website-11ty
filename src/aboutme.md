title: About Me
---

Hi, I'm [Desmond][1], a software developer by trade currently residing in [Montreal][2], 
Canada.

I'm a graduate of the [Engineering Science][3] program (Computer Option) at the 
[University of Toronto][4], currently employed by [Unity Technologies][5].

People who know me tend to assume I'm from [Toronto][6] but I'm actually a native Montrealer.
The confusion usually stems from the fact that, while I was born in Montreal, I spent a 
good chunk of my formative years (i.e. high school and Univeristy) in Toronto, and I only
moved back to Montreal in my 20s.  Having spent a fair bit of time in both cities I like
to think I'm above the typical rivalry shared between them.

While I enjoy programming (or else I wouldn't do it for a living) I wouldn't say that it's
my sole focus in life.I also enjoy reading, television,
cooking, cocktails, board games, photography, philosophy and travelling.

I also enjoy writing, mostly on this website.  I particularly enjoy the web as a medium and I'm
old enough to still be amazed at the idea that anyone can just throw up a website for some spare
change and have it acessible to almost the entire world.

I consider this website to be my main online platform, but you can find me elswhere on the
web as well:
