title: About Me
---

Hi, I'm [Desmond][1], a software developer by trade currently residing in
[Montreal][2], Canada.

I'm a graduate of the [Engineering Science][3] program (Computer Option) at
the [University of Toronto][4], currently employed by [Unity
Technologies][5].

People who know me tend to assume I'm from [Toronto][6] but I'm actually a
native Montrealer.  The confusion usually stems from the fact that, while I
was born in Montreal, I spent a good chunk of my formative years (i.e. high
school and Univeristy) in Toronto, and I only moved back to Montreal in my
20s.  Having spent a fair bit of time in both cities I like to think I'm
above the typical rivalry shared between them.

While I enjoy programming (or else I wouldn't do it for a living) I wouldn't
say that it's my sole focus in life.I also enjoy reading, television,
cooking, cocktails, board games, photography, philosophy and travelling.

I also enjoy writing, mostly on this website.  I particularly enjoy the web
as a medium and I'm old enough to still be amazed at the idea that anyone
can just throw up a website for some spare change and have it acessible to
almost the entire world.

I consider this website to be my main online platform, but you can find me
elswhere on the web as well:
