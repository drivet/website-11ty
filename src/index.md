Hello! You've reached the personal website of
<a class="p-name u-url u-uid" href="/">Desmond Rivet</a>.

You can find out more [about me][1] eleswhere on this site, and some information
[about the site itself][2] if that sort of thing interests you.

There's actually a fair bit to see here, including a [blog][3] and a
[selection of pages][4] spanning, in some cases, a couple of decades.

This site is part of the [IndieWeb][5], a collection of personal websites that
function as a kind of alternative to traditional social media.  I hope you enjoy
your stay but, if you don't, please free to follow the [IndieWeb Webring][6],
located at the bottom of every page, for other sites in the community.
