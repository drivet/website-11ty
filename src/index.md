Hello! You've reached the personal website of <a class="p-name u-url u-uid"
href="/">Desmond Rivet</a>, a <span class="p-note">software developer</span>
living in <span class="p-locality">Montreal<span>, <span
class="p-country">Canada</span>.

You can find out more [about me][1] elsewhere on this site, see what I'm up
to [now][6], and peruse some information [about the site itself][2] if that
sort of thing interests you.

## The Garden and the Stream

My web presence is split between my blog, i.e. [this site][10], where I
[post random thoughts][8] on a semi-regular basis, and my [digital
garden][9], where I maintain a kind of personal wiki of random,
interconnected notes on various topics that interest me.  I wrote [an
article][11] on the differences between these two kinds of websites if you
want to learn more about it.

## On This Site

There's actually a fair bit of content here:

* In addition to the fire hose of all my [posts][8], I also separately
  publish a subset of them in my *[lifestream][3]*, hopefully providing a
  calmer, more curated experience.
* A [collection of curated photo albums][4]
* Various [selected pages][5] from my old sites

This site also used to house my recipe collection after I stopped
maintaining my wiki.  As my wiki has since found new life, of a sort, in my
[digital garden][9], I've decided to move my [recipes][7] there.  We'll see
how long that lasts.

## Contact 

<a class="u-email" href="mailto:hello@desmondrivet.com">Email</a> is
probably the best way to contact me.

I consider this website to be my main online platform, but you can find me
elswhere on the web as well:
