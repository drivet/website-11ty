title: A Trip Down Memory Lane
---

When I started blogging in earnest, around 2007, I basically pushed aside
all of the old content on my website in favour of the new.  The stuff I had
written up until that point was largely forgotten, and started gathering
dust on my old Sun Ultra 10, which was the last machine to host my site
before I finally gave in and started using a web hosting company.

I've recently dug out my Sun Ultra 10 from my closet and have since been
knee-deep in nostalgia.  I think my old site or, at least, selected parts of
it, deserves a home, and this page will act as such - your gateway to the
past!  Expect new (well, actually, *old*) things to show up here as I work
my way through the years.

The content, for the most part, remains unchanged, with a few exceptions
(like converting the HTML to markdown and fixing broken links where
possible).  Enjoy! Or not...

## Personal Stuff

* [PEY - The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly](/oldsite/pey.html)
* [Desmond's Trip to France](/oldsite/france.html). I had a lot of vacation time
  coming to me, so I took three weeks off work and decided to visit France
  in the fall of 2003.

## Projects

* [The Graphics Pipeline](/oldsite/gp.html).  A graphics library I wrote.
* [Animats and Active Vision Systems](/oldsite/thesis.html).  My undergrad thesis.


## Various Essays

* [In Defense of Emacs](/oldsite/emacsdefense.html).  I use emacs.  I sometimes feel the need to defend this.
* [The Computer as a Tool](/oldsite/msdefense.html).  An apology for Microsoft.  I was young once.
* [Why I'll Never Torture Cats](/oldsite/freewill.html). My version of free
  will. Developed from a talk I had with my friends Scott and Philip.
* [Metal Souls and Mental Darwinism](/oldsite/ai.html). I wrote this one about 6
  years ago. It was my first attempt to put into words my beliefs about the
  validity of A.I. I think I was on the wrong track with this essay, but it
  remains here for reference.
* [The Moral Basis for the Right to Health Care](/oldsite/bioessay.html).  I went
  through a libertarian phase in my youth.  Take this essay with a grain of
  salt.
* [The Nature of Omnipotence](/oldsite/god.html). My first attempt at explaining why
  I'm an atheist.
* [Defending Physicalism](/oldsite/essaymind.html). This one was written for my
  fourth year philosophy of mind course. I think it's a persuasive essay.
* [When A Red Ball Is Not A Red Ball](/oldsite/logic.html). My as-yet unfinished
  follow up to <a href="/oldsite/god.html">The Nature of
  Omnipotence</a>. Unpolished but the outline is clear. Heavily influenced
  by the philosophy of mind course I took in my 4th year at U of T
