title: Vanilla Pound Cake
blurb: Pretty tasty pound cake, not purely traditional.  Extract in the glaze tastes fine, though it gives it a brown tinge.

**For Pound Cake**

Preheat oven to 325°F.

Lightly grease a 9 x 5" loaf pan. Line the bottom and short sides with
parchment paper, allowing the ends to hang over for easy removal of the loaf
after baking. Set aside.

In a medium bowl, whisk together flours, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the
butter on medium speed until light and fluffy. About 4-5 minutes.

Add the sugar slowly with the mixer on medium low. Mix until well
incorporated.

Add the eggs and egg yolks, one at time, until fully incorporated. Scrape
the sides of the bowl as needed.

Add the vanilla, mixing until well combined.

Beat the mixture until light and fluffy on medium high speed, about 1 to 2
minutes. We want to incorporate air into the batter.

Add the flour to the egg mixture, alternating with the milk. Begin and end
with the flour mixture. Do not overmix.

Once combined, pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan using an offset
spatula to smooth the top.

Bake for about 60 minutes, checking the cake at 50 minutes. If the top is
browning too quickly, cover the top loosely with aluminum foil.

The cake is done when it springs back when gently pressed on top. A
toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean or with a few
crumbs remaining. Do not overbake or the cake will be dry.

Remove the cake from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes in the pan.

Using the parchment paper ends, pull the loaf from the pan and place on a
cooling rack to cool completely.

**For Vanilla Bean Glaze**

Add confectioner’s sugar and vanilla bean paste to a medium bowl. Add the
whole milk or heavy cream and whisk to combine. If glaze is too thick,
continue adding milk one tablespoon at a time until you have the desired
consistency. If too thin, add more confectioner’s sugar. You want the glaze
to be thick, but pourable.

Spoon the glaze over the top of the completely cooled pound cake, allowing
the glaze to drop over the sides. Let sit for 15 minutes to set before
slicing.

**NOTES**

Store cake tightly covered in a cool, dry place for up to 4 days.

Cake is best the day after it is made as the flavor develops over time.

Cake may be frozen. Freeze the cake before adding the glaze and defrost at
room temperature before serving.
