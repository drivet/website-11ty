Peel and thinly slice the onions from root to stem. There should be about 10
cups of sliced onions in total.

In a 5 to 6 quart thick-bottomed pot, heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil on
medium heat. Add the onions and toss to coat with the olive oil.

Cook the onions, stirring often, until they have softened, about 15 to 20
minutes.

Increase the heat to medium high. Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil
and the butter and cook, stirring often, until the onions start to brown,
about 20 to 40 minutes. The amount of time will vary depending on your pot,
stove, and onions.

Sprinkle with sugar (to help with the caramelization) and 1 teaspoon of
salt. Continue to cook until the onions are well browned, about 10 to 15
more minutes.

Add the minced garlic and cook for a minute more.

Add the wine or vermouth to the pot and scrape up the browned bits on the
bottom and sides of the pot, deglazing the pot as you go.

Add the stock, bay leaves, and thyme. Bring to a simmer, cover the pot and
lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for about 30 minutes.

Season to taste with more salt and add freshly ground black pepper. Discard
the bay leaves. Add brandy if using.

While the soup is simmering, line a sheet pan with parchment paper or foil
and preheat the oven to 450°F with a rack in the upper third of the oven.

Brush both sides of the French bread or baguette slices lightly with olive
oil (you'll end up using about a tablespoon and a half of olive oil for
this).

Put in the oven and toast until lightly browned, about 5 to 7
minutes. Remove from oven.

Turn the toasts over and sprinkle with the grated Gruyere cheese and
Parmesan. Return to oven when it's close to serving time and bake until the
cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.

To serve, ladle soup into a bowl and transfer one cheesy toast onto the top
of each bowl of soup.

Alternatively, you can use individual oven-proof bowls or one large
casserole dish. Ladle the soup into the bowls or casserole dish. Cover with
the toast and sprinkle with cheese. Put into the broiler for 10 minutes at
350 F, or until the cheese bubbles and is slightly browned.
