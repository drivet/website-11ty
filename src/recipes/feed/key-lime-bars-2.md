blurb: |
  This is another decent key lime bar recipe, that's a bit simpler and more
  tangy than the Little Spice Jar version, with a slightly thinner base.

Make crust: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Stir together graham cracker
crumbs, sugar, and butter in a small bowl. Press evenly onto bottom of an
8-inch square glass baking dish. Bake until dry and golden brown, about 10
minutes. Let cool completely on a wire rack.(Leave oven on.)

Make filling: Put egg yolks and lime zest in the bowl of an electric mixer
fitted with the whisk attachment. Mix on high speed until very thick, about
5 minutes. Reduce speed to medium. Add condensed milk in a slow, steady
stream, mixing constantly. Raise speed to high; mix until thick, about 3
minutes. Reduce speed to low. Add lime juice; mix until just combined.

Spread filling evenly over crust using a spatula. Bake, rotating dish
halfway through, until filling is just set, about 10 minutes. Let cool
completely on a wire rack. Refrigerate at least 4 hours (or overnight).

Cut into 2-by-2-inch bars. Garnish bars with whipped cream and a slice of
lime.
