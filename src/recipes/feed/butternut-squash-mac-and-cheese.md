Heat a pot of water to boil for the pasta. Salt the water then add the pasta
and cook to al dente or, with a bite to it.

While pasta cooks, heat a medium heavy bottomed pot over medium heat. Add
the EVOO and butter. When the butter melts into the oil, add the thyme and
grate the onion directly into the pot with a hand held grater or
Microplane. Cook the grated onion in butter and oil 1-2 minutes, then add
flour and cook together 1-2 more minutes. Whisk in stock, then combine with
butternut squash until warmed through and smooth. Stir in cream or
half-and-half and bring sauce to a bubble. Stir in cheeses in a figure 8
motion and season the completed sauce with salt, nutmeg and pepper. Taste to
adjust seasonings.

Drain cooked pasta well and combine with sauce. Serve alongside chicken
sammies and top with thyme leaves picked from remaining sprigs (Boo would
also have a little extra sprinkle of that cheese, please!)
