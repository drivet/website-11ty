Keep a small bowl of water nearby for deglazing.

Heat the oil in a 12-inch heavy-bottomed sauté pan or medium-sized Dutch
oven over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the cumin and coriander seeds for
about 1 minute, tossing frequently, or until aromatic and darker by a few
shades but don’t let them burn!

Add the curry leaves: if using fresh leaves, cover the pan immediately and
stand back to prevent oil splatter. Cook for just 20 seconds to prevent
burning. For dry leaves, cook a little longer.

Add the onions with a big pinch of salt and cook for 5 minutes, until
starting to get some color. If the spices start to darken, lower the heat to
medium. Add a splash of water as needed to prevent onions from browning.

Add garlic, ginger, serrano peppers, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring
frequently.

Add Ground Spices and tomato paste and stir frequently for 90 seconds. If it
dries out, add a splash of water.

Add tomatoes + 2 teaspoons kosher salt. Use tomato juices to scrape up
browned bits. Cook for 5 minutes, or until tomatoes are soft and the oil
starts to release from them.

Pour in chickpeas, coconut milk, water, tahini, and sugar. Stir well and
bring to a simmer. Cover and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, opening the pot to
stir occasionally.

Meanwhile, rinse Swiss chard (or kale) and cilantro and mint. For the
greens, remove the center ribs and discard. Roll the leaves and up slice the
leaves very thinly. Chop the cilantro and mint.

After the simmer time, add the greens. Simmer until tender and wilted, 4 to
5 minutes. Stir in the garam masala to combine.

Off the heat, squeeze in a little lemon or lime juice, cilantro, and
mint. Season to taste with salt (about 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt). Rest for 5
to 15 minutes to allow flavors to meld. Serve with cooked rice or flatbread.

**NOTES**

Note 1: I like the subtle crunch of whole spices. If you don’t, grind your
spices first or roughly crush with the back of a sturdy mug, cast iron pan,
or heavy knife. No whole spices? Use 1 1/2 tsp ground coriander + heaping
1/2 tsp ground cumin with the other ground spices.

Note 2: If you have an Indian grocery store, seek out fresh curry leaves,
which add incredible flavor. Or order dried curry leaves online. The amount
of leaves depends on size. If your curry leaves are large, use the smaller
range.

Note 3: Since this is a fair amount of salt, I’ve specified the salt I
use. For sea salt or Morton’s kosher salt, use less salt, about 1 1/4 tsp. If
using table salt, use 1 tsp.

Note 4: If you can’t have coconut products, check the FAQ section in the
blog post for how to use cashew cream as a substitute.

Note 5: if you prefer a looser consistency in curries, use 3/4 to 1 cup (180
to 240 mL) water.

Note 6: This weighs 7 to 8 oz / 200-230g (stems included). If using more
greens, you need to add more salt. You can sub with bagged baby spinach or
baby kale (I like to roughly chop before adding it to the curry); it’ll cook
in 1-2 minutes.
