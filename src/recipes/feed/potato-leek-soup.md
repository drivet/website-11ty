blurb: Very easy and very tasty.  This should become a staple.  Adapted slightly since I rarely have fresh herbs available.

Melt the butter over medium heat in a large soup pot. Add the leeks and
garlic and cook, stirring regularly, until soft and wilted, about 10
minutes. Adjust the heat as necessary so as not to brown.

Add the potatoes, broth, bay leaves, thyme, salt and pepper to pot and bring
to a boil. Cover and turn the heat down to low. Simmer for 15 minutes, or
until the potatoes are very soft.

Fish out the thyme sprig and bay leaves, then purée the soup with a
hand-held immersion blender until smooth. (Alternatively, use a standard
blender to purée the soup in batches; see note.) Add the heavy cream and
bring to a simmer. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. If soup
is too thin, simmer until thickened. If it's too thick, add water or stock
to thin it out. Garnish with fresh herbs if desired.
