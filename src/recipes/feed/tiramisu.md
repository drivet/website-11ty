Notes: for a stronger coffee flavour, double the coffee.  You can also get
away with using only one cup of the whipping cream, so you don't have to buy
a whole pint.

In a medium saucepan, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until well
blended. Whisk in milk and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until
mixture boils. Boil gently for 1 minute, remove from heat and allow to cool
slightly. Cover tightly and chill in refrigerator 1 hour.

In a medium bowl, beat cream with vanilla until stiff peaks form. Whisk
mascarpone into yolk mixture until smooth.

In a small bowl, combine coffee and rum. Split ladyfingers in half
lengthwise and drizzle with coffee mixture.

Arrange half of soaked ladyfingers in bottom of a 7x11 inch dish. Spread
half of mascarpone mixture over ladyfingers, then half of whipped cream over
that. Repeat layers and sprinkle with cocoa. Cover and refrigerate 4 to 6
hours, until set
