Add olive oil to a big pot.  Turn heat to medium.

When oil starts to shimmer, add onion and carrot and a pinch of salt and
pepper.  Fry for 7 minutes.

Add diced potato and fry for 1 minute.

Add garlic and fry for 30 seconds.

Add cumin, turmeric and ginger and fry for another minute.

Add lentils and fry for another 30 seconds.  Add broth and bring everything
to a boil on high heat.  Once boiling, turn heat to medium low and cover
pot.  Simmer for 15 minutes, until the lentils are soft.

Turn off heat, and with an immersion blender puree the soup until the
texture is creamy but with some chunks still visible.

Add salt, pepper and lemon juice, turn heat back on to medium and simmer for
another minute.
