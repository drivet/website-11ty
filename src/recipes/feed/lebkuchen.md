blurb: |
  This is basically German gingerbread, often made during the Christmas season.
  A cross between a cookie, a cake and a bar.  One of my favourites, absolutely
  delicious.
ingredients:
 For the Dough:
 - 1/2 cup hazelnuts (2 ounces; 57g)
 - 1/2 cup almond meal (2 ounces; 57g)
 - 2 3/4 cups sifted all-purpose flour (about 12 1/2 ounces; 352g)
 - 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa (preferably dark)
 - 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
 - 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
 - 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
 - 1 teaspoon ground powdered ginger
 - 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
 - 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
 - 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
 - 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
 - 1/2 teaspoon (2.8g) kosher salt
 - 1/2 cup tightly packed chopped candied orange rind (4 ounces; 113g)

1. **For the Dough**: Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Spread hazelnuts on a baking sheet
   and toast until the skins blister, about 14 minutes. Let cool slightly, then
   transfer nuts to a clean kitchen towel and rub together to remove the
   skins. Transfer nuts to a food processor and cool completely. Pulse until
   finely ground. Transfer to a bowl along with the almond meal, flour, cocoa,
   baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, powdered ginger, nutmeg, cloves,
   allspice, cardamom, and salt.

2. Put the candied orange rind and crystallized ginger into food processor
   along with 1 cup of the dry ingredient mixture and pulse until very finely
   chopped. Add the remaining dry ingredients and pulse to combine.

3. In the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment,
   beat butter with brown sugar at medium speed until creamy. Add honey and
   beat until smooth. Add eggs and vanilla and beat to combine. At very low
   speed, add dry ingredients by the heaping spoonful (to avoid powder
   eruptions) and beat until combined. Scrape sides and bottom of bowl and
   beat again until evenly combined.

4. **If Making Bars**: Line a 13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheet with
   parchment paper, extending paper a few inches over the short
   sides. Lightly spray the unlined sides of the pan with nonstick cooking
   spray. Spread the dough into a thin, even layer and bake in the center of
   the oven until surface is dimpled and a toothpick inserted into the
   center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. The cake should be springy but
   firm. Let cool on a rack for 15 minutes.

5. **If Making Individual Round Cookies**: Chill dough until quite firm,
   about 4 hours. Working in 2 batches, line 2 large cookie sheets with
   parchment. Dip a 1 3/4-inch ice cream scoop (2 level tablespoons) into
   water, shake off excess water, and scoop level scoops of dough. Roll into
   balls and place 2 inches apart. Bake in the lower and middle thirds of
   the oven, shifting pans from top to bottom and front to back halfway
   through, until a toothpick inserted in center of cookies comes out clean,
   about 18 minutes. Slide parchment onto a wire rack to let cookies cool
   slightly while you bake the remaining cookies.

6. **For the Glaze**: In a medium bowl, whisk confectioners' sugar with
   kirsch and add enough water to make a thin but spreadable glaze. Spread
   glaze on just-warm cake or cookies and let cool completely. If making
   bars, slide cake (with parchment) from pan onto cutting board. Cut into 8
   short strips, then cut each strip into 6 bars.
