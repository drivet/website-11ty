title: Mexican Rice (Desmond's version)
blurb: |
  Adapted from various sources around the Internet. I add beans, 
  to make it more meal-like, not just a side dish.  I don't bother 
  measuring out the onion or pepper. And I use vegetable broth to
  make it vegetarian.

In a heavy skillet saut√© onion, celery and bell pepper on medium-high heat until softened, about 7
minutes.  Add garlic and cook 1 minute more.  Add rice to skillet and cook
over until rice has browned slightly. Add tomatoes, chili powder,
cumin, salt, and broth. Bring to a boil; cover, lower heat, and simmer until
liquid has been absorbed, about 15 minutes.  Add the beans, continue cooking
