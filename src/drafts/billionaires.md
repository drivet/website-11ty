Look, I never thought that the law applied equally to rich people and poor
people.  I never considered myself that naive.  I always understand that
rich people could break the law in ways that poor people simply couldn't.

But I had always assumed that what being rich bought you, in terms of
getting away with criminal activity, was just a heightened ability to cover
your tracks.  I had always assumed that, whether you were rich or poor, it
was of paramount importance to not get caught, and that being rich simply
bought you more options in that regard.  Maybe you could bribe a police
officer, or a judge, and make the charges go away.  Maybe you could afford
to hire someone to do the dirty work for you, or take the fall for you if it
came to that.

But, and here's where I guess I was a bit naive, I had always assumed that
if, for whatever reason, you *were* caught, and it was blindingly clear,
from a legal standpoint, that you did the thing of which you were accused,
then, rich or poor, you'd be charged and convicted.

This is, of course, bullshit.  What Trump has taught me is that you actually
don't even have to cover your tracks.  You just have to convince the right
people to not care.  To ignore the evidence of their eyes and ears.  And, of
course, it doesn't hurt that the highest court in the land says that the law
just...doesn't apply to you.

I'm not trying to sound dramatic, but the last 8 years have broken whatever
paltry sense of justice I used to have.  Laws only matter if people are
willing to enforce them, and I don't believe there's anyone left in power
to do so.
