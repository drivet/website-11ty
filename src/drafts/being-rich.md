I never thought that the law applied equally to rich people and poor people.
I never considered myself that naive.  I always understood that rich people
could break the law in ways that poor people simply couldn't.

But I had always assumed that the way this worked in practice was that being
rich just came with a heightened ability to cover your tracks.  I had always
assumed that, rich or poor, it was of supreme importance *not to get
caught*, and that being rich simply bought you more options in that regard.
Maybe you could bribe a police officer, or a judge, and make the charges go
away.  Maybe you could afford to hire someone to do the dirty work for you,
or take the fall for you if it came to that.

But, and here's where I was a profoundly naive, I had always assumed that
if, for whatever reason, you *were* caught, and it was blindingly clear,
from a legal standpoint, that you did the thing of which you were accused,
then, rich or poor, you'd be charged and convicted.  Like...I had always
assumed, for example, that if you committed a murder and it was caught on
camera then, rich or poor, it was game over for you.

What the past few years have taught me, of course, is that this is bullshit.
Once you reach a certain level of wealth, you don't even have to cover your
tracks.  You can brazenly commit your crimes in broad daylight, and you just
have to convince the right people not to care.  To ignore the evidence of
their eyes and ears.  And, of course, it doesn't hurt that the highest court
in the land says that the law just...doesn't apply to you.

I'm not trying to sound dramatic, but the last few years have broken
whatever paltry sense of justice I used to have.  Laws only matter if people
are willing to enforce them, and I don't believe there's anyone left in
power to do so.
