I'm 47 years old, and most of the people I work with are much younger than I
am - often in their 20's and 30's.  Cultural references that I think are
universal sometimes turn out to be pretty specific to my age group in ways
that surprise me.

Take something like Bugs Bunny.  Most people, young and old, have of course
*heard* of Bugs Bunny but it turns out that not a lot of young people grew
up watching it.  I have, and it is [because of this cartoon][1] that I
happen vaguely know some of the music to [The Barber of Seville][2].

So when I told some of my workmates that I was visiting Seville, and that I
would be visiting all the sites *as well as a barber*, no one got the joke.
They took one look at my shaved head and with genuine confusion would
proceed to inform me that I have no hair and hence would not need the
services of a barber.

Growing old is *awful*, y'all.

Anyway! After [Barcelona][3], Evelyn and I hopped on a train and headed to
Seville.  We had booked 3 nights.  It's not a destination you often hear
about in connection with a trip to Spain, but had heard that it was
beautiful, and well worth the visit.

I had *also* heard that it was "underrated" and so I had assumed that it
would be less crowded than Barcelona.  Was I right?  Let's find out!

Our apartment was located across from [Las Setas][4], an odd, mushroom shaped
structure a short walk from the Old Town.
