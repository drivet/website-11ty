I'm 47 years old, and most of the people I work with are much younger than I
am - often in their 20's and 30's.  Cultural references that I think are
universal sometimes turn out to be pretty specific to my age group in ways
that surprise me.

Take something like Bugs Bunny.  Most people, young and old, have of course
*heard* of Bugs Bunny but it turns out that not a lot of young people grew
up watching it.  I have, and it is [because of this cartoon][1] that I
happen vaguely know some of the music to [The Barber of Seville][2].

So when I told some of my workmates that I was visiting Seville, and that I
would be visiting all the popular sites *as well as a barber*, no one got
the joke.  They took one look at my shaved head and with genuine confusion
would proceed to inform me that I have no hair and hence would not need the
services of a barber.

Growing old is *awful*, y'all.

Anyway! After [Barcelona][3], Evelyn and I hopped on a train and headed to
Seville.  We had booked 3 nights.  It's not a destination you often hear
about in connection with a trip to Spain, but I had heard that it was
beautiful, and well worth the visit.

I had *also* heard that it was "underrated" and so I had assumed that it
would be less crowded than Barcelona.  Was I right?  Let's find out!

## Arrival

Our apartment was located across from [Las Setas][4], an odd, mushroom
shaped structure a short walk from the Old Town.  The accommodations were a
cross between an Airbnb and a hotel - it was a full apartment with fridge
and stove, but we didn't have to share the place with anyone.  Nice enough
digs, and a damn sight quieter than Barcelona.

In terms of location, we were about a half hour walk from the Plaza de
Espana, which I was desperate to see right away.  Plaza de Espana is the
"postcard" attraction of Seville - it's what shows up when you search for
"Seville" in a search engine and choose "images".  Try and you'll see what I
mean, and you'll also understand why I wanted to see this thing so bad.

The best way to get to the Plaza de Espana is to go through the Barrio de
Santa Cruz, otherwise known as the Old Town, or Jewish Quater of Seville, a
gorgeously colourful collection of narrow streets, alleyways and squares.
It reminded me a bit of El Born in Barcelona but way less gritty and better
maintained - so well maintained, in fact, that Evelyn thought the whole
thing looked a bit unreal, like a theme park.  I can see where she's coming
from and I don't entirely disagree, but I still found myself enjoying the
neighbourhood's twists and turns, even if I was sharing the experience with
thousands of other tourists.

Santa Cruz is home to some of the most popular tourist attractions in
Seville, like the Cathedral and the Royal Alcazar and though these were
definitely on my list of things to see - I had already bought tickets for
both of them for the following day - at the moment I had my sights set on
the Plaza.  From the directions we were going, we approached it from behind,
turned a corner and...voila.

It's hard to describe what hits your eyes when you turn the corner.
It's\...immense, certainly, enough to catch your breath, but that's not
quite the whole story.  The entire package just sort of catches your eye,
from the square in front of the building, to the colourful, tiled mosaics,
to the symmetrical twin towers on either end, to the little stream running
through it all.  It's just...stunning, in a quite literal way - I was
speechless for a few seconds the first time I saw it.

I was surprised to learn that the Plaza de Espana isn't actually very old;
it was built in 1929 for the Seville World Fair.  It was designed to
impress, and accomplishes the goal effortlessly.  I was more disappointed to
learn that the building now houses mostly government offices but I guess you
got to do *something* with all that space.

## Second

The next day was reserved for our two main paid attractions in Seville: the
Royal Alcazar and the Seville Cathedral.

The Royal Alcazar is the Spanish royal family's official residence when
they stay in Seville and it looks like something out of Morocco.
