description: |
  <p>My lifestream feed is probably best understood as an extended version of my blog,
  a combined feed of notes, articles, photos and videos, but without all the replies,
  likes and reposts that can sometimes add unwanted noise to an IndieWeb site. </p>
  <p>My <a href="/posts/">entire feed</a> is available as well.</p>
