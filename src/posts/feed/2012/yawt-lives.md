title: YAWT Lives!
---

I started this blog 4 years ago, got a few entries in, and then promptly
shut the whole thing down when it got overrun with spam.  I have now
resurrected it, using a new version of YAWT written in python which, for
lack of a better name, I shall call YAWT 2.0.

At some point, I hope to write an article on the features of YAWT 2.0, but
for the moment I'm just happy this thing is working again.  Somewhat
working, anyway; comments are still deactivated until I figure out how to do
it properly.
