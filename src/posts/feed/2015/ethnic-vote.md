title: Reflections on the Ethnic Vote
---

Jacques Parizeau died not too long ago.  He infamously commented that the
1995 Quebec Referendum was lost due to [money and the ethnic vote][1].

I was in high school, in Toronto, during the referendum.  I remember my
school following the whole thing very closely.  I remember feeling relief
when the No side won (by a hair) and I remember the uproar that his
statements caused afterwards.

A word about my background before we go on.  It's a bit of a mixed bag.  I
have a British first name (Desmond) and a French last name (Rivet).  My
mother is Sicilian.  My father was French Canadian, though not technically
Quebecois by birth (he was born in Sudbury).  I myself was born in Montreal,
so I *am*, in fact, a Quebecois by birth, but an Anglophone one, despite my
last name.  To make things more complicated, I spent a lot of my formative
years (high school, University) in Toronto, so people often assume I'm from
there.

Given this kind of background, it's sometimes hard to say where my loyalties
lie, but I think it's probably safe to say that they *don't* lie with
abstract, disembodied ideas like "Canada" or "Quebec" or "Italians".  All
this to say, if I had voted in the referendum, I would have, of course,
voted No.

Anyway, I can remember everyone being quite offended at his remarks, but I
*also* remember thinking, evenly and without rancor, that they were *true*.
The No side probably won because of the ethnic vote - and *thank God*.

I assume that "ethnic", in this context, is simply a euphemism for "not
white and not French".  By that definition...well...yes, the Quebec
referendum was indeed defeated by the ethnic vote, for the prosaic reason
that if you exclude non-whites and non-French, the Yes side would have won
(something like 60% of French speakers in Quebec voted Yes).

I don't believe this is a very controversial thing to observe - or at least
it *shouldn't* be.  It frankly shouldn't be surprising to anyone.  *Of
course* minorities voted against Quebec sovereignty.  Do you think the
xenophobia started with the [Charter][2]?

None of this really matters, of course, because people weren't actually
reacting to the truth or falsehood of Parizeau's statements, but rather to
the spirit in which they were delivered.  What he said may or may not have
been technically true, but that's beside the point.  The point was the
utterly dismissive way in which he said them.  *That* is what people found
offensive.  He was obliquely implying that the "ethnic vote", as he called
it, didn't really count.  He was implying that the people casting those
votes weren't real Quebecers.

You walk a tight line when you're a staunch nationalist, especially when
your [brand of nationalism hinges on a single perceived cultural
heritage][5] which new arrivals don't necessarily share.  I have a hard time
imagining how such a thing could ever work without devolving into naked
mistrust of anyone who's "outside the circle", so to speak.  It's part of
the reason [I don't consider myself a nationalist][3] - or, at least, not
*that* kind of nationalist.

Other forms of nationalism are possible, of course.  The one I subscribe to,
if one insists on giving it a label, would probably be considered a loose
form of [civic nationalism][4].  It's the kind of nationalism that focuses
mainly on individual rights and defining the proper boundaries between the
government and the governed, rather than the care and feeding of a shared
culture.  It's a very loose, "live and let live" kind of national identity,
barely deserving of the name.  At the very least, one's nationality is not
closely tied, in this scheme, to one's culture of choice.

This is the sort of nationalism that I suspect minorities in Quebec could
get behind, but it isn't the prevailing sentiment.  Quebec nationalism has a
strong cultural component to it, sometimes flirting with a mild form of full
on [ethnic nationalism][6], as evidenced by the [Charter][2] fiasco a couple
of years ago.  The Charter was sold as an attempt to purge religious
influence from the civil service, but it came off rather as an attempt to
purge *otherness* instead.

I belong to a school of thought which advocates
[the separation of culture and state][7] in the same way, and for exactly
the same reasons, as the separation of church and state.  It is, however, an
unfortunate reality in this province that, for a lot of people, their
culture is indelibly linked to nationhood and state involvement.  It's an
odd stance to take, considering how many are against state involvement in
religious matters.  The irony appears to be lost on many.
