Yes, I know that the word "chai" literally just means "tea" in Hindi (and
other languages) and that the term "chai tea" is therefore technically
redundant.  I don't care.  I will still occasionally say "chai tea" and I
don't feel like I'm committing some kind of linguistic sin by doing so.

The English translation of "chai" is, of course, "tea" and it refers to a
very generic category of usually hot and often caffeinated beverages made
from steeping various kinds of leaves.  On the other hand, the word "chai"
*in English* usually refers to a very specific kind of spiced tea, often
taken with milk, that Westerners typically associate with the culinary
tradition of South Asia.  One would not normally use the word "chai" *in
English* to refer to the bog standard Orange Pekoe that one might drink for
a caffeine fix in the morning before work.

I *could* just use the word "chai" on its own to refer to this spiced
beverage and leave it at that, but if I'm comparing it to other kinds of
tea, like Earl Grey or Irish Breakfast, then I might add the word "tea"
after each item to stress the unifying concept.  So I might say "Earl Grey
tea", "Irish Breakfast tea" or (the horror!) "chai tea".

My point is that the word "chai" *in English* doesn't mean the same thing as
it does in other languages, despite being borrowed from those languages.
Sometimes chai is used as more of an adjective than a noun, and that's just
how languages work.  They borrow words and they change them.

It's exactly the same battle with a word like "naan".  I know it just means
"bread" in Persian but that's simply not how the word is used in English.
In English it refers to a specific kind of flat bread, usually made in a
specific kind of oven.  I mean, a French baguette is just "bread" as well,
but I suspect you wouldn't use the word "naan" to describe it.

And yes, I *would* use the (technically redundant) combination "naan bread"
if, like the tea example above, I was trying to differentiate naan from
various other kinds of bread, like sourdough or pita, and I wanted to
emphasize the unifying characteristic of all the things I was talking about.

So stop with the sanctimonious word policing, already!  Languages evolve and
trade, and this is just one example in a very long line of examples.
