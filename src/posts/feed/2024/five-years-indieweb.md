About five years ago, in early 2019, I stumbled upon the [IndieWeb][1], a
movement and community dedicated to modernizing the personal website.  I
quickly became enamoured with its ideas and spent the next year revamping my
website and blog to make it more compliant with their standards.

I've [written about the IndieWeb][26] before but if you're just tuning in,
there are several dimensions to it:

 * There's an emphasis on owning your own domain and on integrating
   [IndieAuth][2], a way of using your domain as a form of authentication -
   something of a spiritual successor to [OpenID][3] .
 * There's the formalization of the notion of a [post][4] (via a technology
   called [microformats][5]) and a relatively sophisticated taxonomy system
   and algorithm for [identifying different kinds of posts][6] "in the
   wild", so to speak.
 * There are [webmentions][7], a way for websites to talk to each other,
   after a fashion, allowing a kind of decentralized social network to
   emerge out of the cacophony of standalone blogs.
 * There's a [conceptual framework for cross posting your content to third
   party applications][8] and for [harvesting interactions on said applications
   to your own site][9].
 * There's a standard, known as [Micropub][10], for publishing new posts on
   your website.

I pretty much went whole hog here; my website and publishing workflow
supports all of the above, and [link previews][12] to boot.  Not
particularly *well*, mind you, but that's a different conversation.

Owning your own data, and collecting it in one place, just felt right to me,
as I've always been a bit uneasy with the idea of leaving my online presence
spread out among a handful of third party applications.  The nerd in me also
appreciated the way the IndieWeb both generalized the notion of a post, and
classified individual posts into specific types, like [articles][15] or
[notes][14]; I'd often mulled over rudimentary versions of this kind of
scheme in the past, but never really had the wherewithal to implement it.

(To be fair, the IndieWeb post classification scheme is not perfect.  In
particular, I don't find it particularly useful to distinguish between
certain types of posts, like notes or photos or [videos][16]; to me, these
are all just different variations of a note.  In general, I think it's more
useful to firmly distinguish between original content, such as articles or
notes, which have their roots in traditional blogging, and derivative
content, such as [likes][17], [reposts][18] and [replies][19], which seem to
have come about as a response to the emergence of social networking.  This
personal preference surfaces in my blog via my ["Lifestream"][20] feed which
houses all my original content into one feed)

My blog never had a lot of readers, and I never had a ton of followers on
social media, so while the social networking aspects of the IndieWeb,
particularly the webmentions, certainly intrigued me, they were never what
sold me.  I wrote this a few years ago, for example, in my inaugural post
introducing myself to the IndieWeb at large:

> Even if the entire IndieWeb consisted of a single personal website, it
> would still "work", in the sense that the owner of the website would be in
> control of their own content and would still be able to share that content
> with their friends on (say) Twitter.

This reveals something of my mindset at the time, I think.  The IndieWeb,
for me at least, was mainly about owning and organizing your content in one
place, under your control.  It was about curating your online presence and
identity.  It was about an efficient publication flow.  It *wasn't* really
about talking to other people.

A good thing too, because while the IndieWeb is a *very* cool idea, I can't
honestly say that it ever really took off.  It remains, five years after I
joined, a niche concept, for various reasons that others have explored.  So
if you made your website IndieWeb compliant with the express purpose of
connecting with other people *on the IndieWeb*...well, I'm not saying that
you'll find a ghost town, but you certainly won't find the bustling
metropolis that is Facebook or Twitter (I will never call it X).

Don't get me wrong - after the Musk takeover of Twitter, decentralized
social networking is certainly having a moment, but it's mostly in the form
of [ActivityPub][21], the protocol that powers [Mastodon][22] and a host of
other applications specializing in different things, such as [photo][23] or
[book][24] sharing.  And while these applications are certainly a step up
from the standard crop of corporate backed [silos][25], they aren't a
replacement for a personal website; your online presence and content, while
nominally under your control, is still spread out across different
platforms - platforms which come with a certain amount of lock-in.  As I've
mentioned before, it's not something that really appeals to me.  One of the
main advantages of using something like microformats instead is that your
posts remain plain, vanilla HTML.  It's basically the old school web - with
some extra metadata for the sake of interoperability.  This *does* appeal to
me.

Still, if you joined the IndieWeb in the hopes of being part of a
conversation and have been disappointed, these ActivityPub based
applications might do the trick.  You can even self-host them, if you've got
the time and inclination.

But while I do use these applications, they will never be my main presence
online.  And I think, at the end of the day, this is what the IndieWeb has
*truly* offered me - a framework for me to have a discoverable online
presence in a way that doesn't put me at the mercy of companies or
applications that may disappear at a moment's notice.  Even if I'm just one
voice shouting into a silent void, there is value in that.
