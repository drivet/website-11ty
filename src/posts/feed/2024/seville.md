I'm 47 years old, and most of the people I work with are much younger than I
am - often in their 20's and 30's.  Cultural references that I think are
universal sometimes turn out to be pretty specific to my age group in ways
that surprise me.

Take something like Bugs Bunny.  Most people, young and old, have of course
*heard* of Bugs Bunny but it turns out that not a lot of young people grew
up watching it.  I have, and it is [because of this cartoon][1] that I
happen to vaguely know some of the music to [The Barber of Seville][2].

So when I told some of my workmates that I was visiting Seville, and that I
would be visiting all the famous sites *as well as a barber*, no one got the
joke.  They took one look at my shaved head and with genuine confusion would
proceed to inform me that I have no hair and hence would not need the
services of a barber.

Growing old is *awful*, y'all.

Anyway! After [Barcelona][3], Evelyn and I hopped on a high-speed train and
headed to Seville.  We had booked 3 nights.  It's not a destination you
often hear about in connection with a trip to Spain, but I had heard that it
was beautiful, and well worth the visit.

I had *also* heard that it was "underrated" and so I had assumed that it
would be less crowded than Barcelona.  Was I right?  Let's find out!

## Arrival

Our apartment was located across from [Las Setas][4], an odd, mushroom
shaped structure a short walk from the Old Town.  The accommodations were a
cross between an Airbnb and a hotel - it was a full apartment with fridge
and stove, but we didn't have to share the place with anyone.  Nice enough
digs, and a damn sight quieter than Barcelona.

In terms of location, we were about a half hour walk from the Plaza de
Espana, which I was desperate to see right away.  [Plaza de Espana][5] is
the "postcard" attraction of Seville - it's what shows up when you search
for "Seville" in a search engine and choose "images".  Try it and you'll see
what I mean, and you'll also understand why I wanted to see this thing so
bad.

The best way to get to the Plaza de Espana is to go through the [Barrio de
Santa Cruz][6], otherwise known as the Old Town, or Jewish Quarter, a
gorgeously colourful collection of narrow streets, alleyways and squares.
It reminded me a bit of El Born in Barcelona but way less gritty and better
maintained - so well maintained, in fact, that Evelyn thought the whole
thing looked a bit unreal, like a theme park.  I could see where she was
coming from and I didn't entirely disagree, but I still found myself
enjoying the neighbourhood's twists and turns, even if I was sharing the
experience with thousands of other tourists.

So...Seville is definitely *not* some kinda of underrated "secret".  It was
definitely crowded, though the tourist demographic may have skewed a little
bit older than Barcelona.

Santa Cruz is home to some of the most popular tourist attractions in the
city, like the Cathedral and the Royal Alcazar and though these were
definitely on my list of things to see - I had already bought tickets for
both of them for the following day - at the moment I had my sights set on
the Plaza.  From the direction we were going, we approached it from behind,
turned a corner and...voila.

It's hard to describe what hits your eyes when you turn the corner.
It's...immense, certainly, and your breath catches, but that's not quite the
whole story.  The entire package just sort of catches your eye, from the
square in front of the building, to the colourful, tiled mosaics, to the
symmetrical twin towers on either end, to the little stream running through
it all.  It's just...stunning, in a quite literal way - I was speechless for
a few seconds when I saw it.

I was surprised to learn that the Plaza de Espana isn't actually very old;
it was built in 1929 for the Seville World Fair.  It was designed to
impress, and accomplishes the goal effortlessly.  I was more disappointed to
learn that the building now houses mostly government offices but I guess you
got to do *something* with all that space.

Also: not that I was looking very hard, but I did not find a barber this
day.  I *did* however, find [Rosina's Balcony][14], by all accounts the
inspiration for the opera.

## Second Day

The next day was reserved for our two main paid attractions in Seville: the
[Royal Alcazar][7] and the [Seville Cathedral][8].

First up was the Royal Alcazar, the Spanish royal family's official
residence when they stay in Seville.  It looks like something out of
Morocco.  At first I thought it was actually built by Moorish invaders but,
alas, the truth is a bit more mundane.  Though originally the site of a 10th
century Islamic citadel, progressive conquests and reconstructions have led
to current palace, a Mud√©jar-style estate dating back to the 14th century,
near the end of Islamic rule in Spain.  It *looks* like something
[Scheherazade][9] may have cooked up but it was actually built by European
Christians as a Christian residence, though very much in the style of the
conquering Moors.

The place is mind-blowing.  To some extent, I suppose, it must have been the
novelty of the whole thing - I'd never seen anything quite it.  When you
visit Europe, you're used to seeing a lot of churches and castles and
palaces of a certain look and feel, and the Alcazar just doesn't fit that
mould.

When the tour was over, we had lunch, walked a bit and then stood in line
for the Seville Cathedral.  Like the Alcazar, the church has Islamic origins
and was originally the site of a large mosque.  Nothing remains of the
original structure except, notably, the [Giralda tower][10], which totally
looks the part.

I usually don't bother with church tours when I visit Europe, but this one
came highly recommended, for reasons I didn't fully grasp until I saw it.
The Seville Cathedral is the largest Gothic cathedral in the world and
although I understand what that means *abstractly* it's still a big hit to
the brain when you go inside and see just what that means in practice.

I could say that it's huge, but what does that even mean?  Legend has it
that the architects wanted to build a church so big the world thought they
were crazy.  Mission accomplished - the size is impossible to convey in
words, and difficult in photos (I [tried][11], and mostly failed, I think).
Let's just say that when you go inside you feel very, very, very small.  My
first reaction was to wonder how on earth they keep the ceilings clean.

There are, reportedly, over 80 chapels (distinct altars or areas where
people can kneel and pray) inside but, again, I'm not exactly sure what I'm
supposed to do with that information.  How many chapels does a church
usually have?  I have no idea.

What I *do* know is that the main chapel is called, unsurprisingly, the Main
Chapel, and that it houses one of the most breathtaking works of art I've
ever seen in my life: the [Ritablo Mayor][12], or Main Altarpiece, an
unassuming name for something so incredibly *extra*.

The Ritablo Mayor stands roughly 60 feet tall and consists of matrix or grid
of Bible scenes, all carved out of wood and gilded to the hilt.  In a time
when most people couldn't read, this was meant to familiarize them with
selected Bible stories, the way a comic book might today.

Oh! And the Cathedral is also the final resting place of one Christopher
Columbus.  An asshole, to be sure, but the history is deep here.

Side note: on this second day, I still did not find a barber.  Is there just
one barber in Seville, the one the opera's about?  It feels like it.  Anyway
I didn't find him.

## Third Day

The third day in Seville was mostly just exploration and if you're going to
do that, one neighbourhood stands out: [Triana][13].  At least, that's what
the Internet and guidebooks say, which means that it's still just as
touristy as the rest of town.

I'm being a bit unfair.  Triana definitely had a lot of tourists but it also
had a lot of stretches that just seemed...uninteresting.  Therein lies rub
when it comes to the dichotomy between "authentic" and "touristy".
Generally speaking, touristy places are like that for a reason - and, by
contrast, the non-touristy, authentic spots are *also* like that for a
reason.

When we first crossed the bridge to Trina, for example, after a bit of
wandering, we settled on a bar that felt pretty local.  It wasn't a bad
spot, and the food was okay, but...it was definitely not catering to us.  I
think people sometimes don't realize that "real" Spaniards drink local beer
and eat fries and pizza like the rest of us.  I honestly think the place
could have become better over upon multiple visits but we never got the
chance.

It turns out that we actually crossed the wrong bridge.  We meant to cross
the Puente de Isabel II, which was supposed to take us directly into the
main part of the neighbourhood, with all the popular restaurants and bars,
but instead we crossed a bridge or two earlier and ended up in a part of
town that was much more residential and local - as represented by the bar we
settled on.  We didn't quite know where we were, and we couldn't quite
figure out why there wasn't anything interesting around us.  Again, it all
comes back to be authentic versus touristy, and being careful what you wish
for.

Anyway, Trina as a whole definitely had a totally different vibe from the
Old Town.  While the Old Town felt a bit like a theme park, Trina felt like
a real neighbourhood, like people actually lived there.  It probably
deserves more exploration.

(Seriously, where are all the barbers?  I couldn't even find one in Triana,
and *this* time I was actually looking.  I guess tourists don't really need
their hair cut)

## Comparison with Barcelona

Inevitably, when I tell people that I went to both Seville and Barcelona,
people will ask me which I prefer.

It's a tough question to answer, because I genuinely liked both cities.  I
*will* say, however, that while I think Seville is a prettier town than
Barcelona, I felt that there was more going on in the latter.  Seville felt
like a town of tourist attractions, and you begin to think that there's
maybe not much going on beyond that.  Barcelona *also* has a ton of tourist
attractions, but one gets the impression that there's an honest-to-goodness
city to be explored once you move past them.

So on the whole I guess Barcelona has a slight edge here, though I would
gladly revisit both.

(Ironically, on the train *out* of Seville to Madrid...we finally caught
sight of a barber shop.  I think Seville is missing out on a lucrative
opportunity here)
