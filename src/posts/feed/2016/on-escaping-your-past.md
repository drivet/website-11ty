title: On Trying to Escape Your Past
---

There's an Irish joke that runs as follows:

> A journalist, researching for an article on the complex political
situation in Northern Ireland, was in a pub in a war-torn area of
Belfast. One of his potential informants leaned over his pint of Guinness
and suspiciously cross-examined the journalist: "Are you a Catholic or a
Protestant?" the Irishman asked.
>
>"Neither," replied the journalist; "I'm an atheist."
>
>The Irishman, not content with this answer, put a further question: "Ah,
but are you a Catholic atheist or a Protestant atheist?

This joke resonates with me.  I think it's both funny and profound.  Funny
for obvious reasons, and profound because it succinctly illuminates the
importance people attach to labels.

Despite a nominally Catholic upbringing, I used to identify with the
reporter in that joke.  I go even further; not only am I an atheist, but I'm
also pro choice, pro contraception and pro gay marriage.  You'd think that
disagreeing with pretty much all of the Church's core beliefs and being an
out and out *atheist* would disqualify me from any kind of "Catholic" label,
right?

You'd *think* that this would be the case - and then you read an article
like [Raised Catholic][1] from [tvtropes.org][2] and you begin to wonder if
it's really that simple.  The title quote from that article stands out:

>I wouldn't be a very spiritual man, right. I don't believe in God,
right. Still Catholic. Because there's nothing you can do when you're
Catholic. Once you've started Catholic, frankly, there's no real way to stop
being Catholic. Even not believing in God isn't regarded as sufficient
reason to get out of the Catholic Church.

It's kind of a scary thought, but it does explain the existence of people
who still identify as something they call "Catholic", whilst simultaneously
not giving a second thought to the purchase of a pack of condoms at the
drugstore.

They are, I suppose, what one would call "cultural Catholics".  Like the
related "cultural Jew", who doesn't really keep the Sabbath *but* who still
identifies as Jewish, still visits their family and goes to temple on high
holidays, and who still (I imagine) waxes poetic about their Grandmother's
latkes and matzo ball soup, the cultural Catholic doesn't go to Confession,
and doesn't really pay much attention to Catholic dogma *but* still
identifies as Catholic and still visits family and goes to Mass on Sundays
(or at least Christmas and Easter).  The cultural Catholic treats the Church
as more of a social club than a place of worship.

So am I a cultural Catholic?  As I said before, I never thought so.  I
haven't been to Mass in years.  I don't wear a crucifix (anymore).  I'm not
particularly close to my family.

And yet...I *do* celebrate Christmas and Easter.  The days are usually
marked with a visit to my Mom and with a meal that isn't usually eaten the
rest of the year (often lasagna or veal).  Every year, I set up and decorate
a Christmas tree.  I exchange gifts.  If this isn't culturally Catholic, or
least culturally Christian, I don't know what is.

I went to Catholic school for twelve years.  I was baptized, confirmed, and
at one time in my life (a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away) was a
weekly Churchgoer.  I suppose it would be naive of me to imagine that I came
out the other end of that experience unscathed.

Catholics say that baptism leaves an indelible mark on your soul. So what
kind of mark did it leave on mine?

## Catholic Atheism

What does a Catholic atheist look like, and how is such a creature different
from a non-Catholic atheist?  It's hard for me to say offhand, because it's
hard for me to trace a line from me *now* to me *then*.  It can sometimes
take a conscious effort for me to separate the Catholic bits from the normal
bits, because it *all* seemed normal at the time and, to some extent, still
does.

It's like, didn't *everyone* learn about Jesus and the Trinity in school?
What do you mean, *no*?  It takes a bit of introspection to realize that
certain things which seem perfectly normal to a Catholic must seem well and
truly bizarre to others.

One way to approach the problem is to ask different but related questions.
What, for example, does a Jewish atheist look like?  Or a Muslim atheist?
Or a Mormon atheist?

I don't know the answers to those questions either, but I can make what I
hope are educated guesses.  I *imagine*, for example, that a Jewish atheist
might still write "G-d" instead of "God", or might still avoid mixing meat
and dairy - not for religious reasons, of course, but for that most prosaic
of reasons: that old habits die hard.  If you were brought up avoiding
cheeseburgers, then maybe you continue to avoid cheeseburgers into
adulthood, even if the gesture no longer has any religious significance.

This might be especially true if everyone else around you is doing the same
thing.  I remember reading somewhere that kosher laws are much, much less
about the laws themselves and much, much more about the group identity they
foster.  Kosher laws, by this reckoning, function as a kind of "secret
handshake", the recognition of which grants you access to the clubhouse.

This interpretation makes complete sense to me.  Catholics are *all* about
the secret handshake.

By the same token, I imagine that Muslim atheists might still avoid alcohol.
They might still wear a headscarf. They might be more inclined to take a
story with genies in it a bit more seriously then the rest of us (even if
they don't actually believe in the existence of genies).  A Mormon atheist
might still find inspiration in the story of [Joseph Smith][16], even if
they don't believe in its literal truth.

And a Catholic atheist?  Well, maybe this hypothetical creature sees no
reason to stop eating fish on Fridays, because that's what they've always
done and why stop now?  Maybe they still wear a crucifix long past the point
where it means anything even remotely spiritual.  Maybe they would never,
ever consider having an abortion, even while firmly believing that every
woman has the right to choose.

Those familiar with my [opinions on the Charter fiasco][2a] a couple of
years ago may note a certain irony in my statements, in that I am now
claiming that a crucifix *is* or, at least, *can be* a cultural artifact, as
opposed to a religious one.  The people who drafted the Charter were right
after all!  But, truth be told, I never actually thought that Christians
didn't have the right to regard a crucifix as a purely cultural symbol,
devoid of spiritual significance.  My objection, rather, was that the
architects of the Charter seemed unwilling to extend the same courtesy to
other religions.  A headscarf, for example, was deemed a religious artifact,
with no room for conversation on the matter.

I myself, in point of fact, wore a crucifix for a long time after I decided
that I was an atheist.  Old habits die hard indeed.

Old habits die hard in other ways as well.  I'll admit to a certain
preoccupation with Catholic dogma.  The concept of the [Trinity][3] and
[debates][4] about the exact nature of [Jesus' relationship to God][5]
sometimes make for (what I consider to be) engaging reading.  I find
[transubstantiation][6] to be a rather absorbing religious doctrine, despite
being utterly bonkers.

Transubstantiation, by the way, is the main reason why I try not to judge
other religions too harshly for having seemingly weird ideas.  Your religion
says that you get your own planet when you die?  How cute!  *My* religion
says that this grape juice you see before you is the real,
honest-to-goodness blood of Jesus and that this wafer is a part of his leg.

Mormons.  Amateurs, I tell you.  Don't try to outweird a Catholic.

Please allow me, at this point, to be perfectly clear.  I do not, obviously,
believe in the literal truth of Catholic dogma.  That would be, you know,
*crazy*. But, like the Greek myths, I find that they often make for *good
stories*.

As such, I think I can safely say that being raised Catholic has affected my
taste in entertainment.  I claimed earlier that an otherwise non-religious
Muslim might be more willing than most to accept a story about genies as
serious cultural fodder.  My basis for that statement involves a bit of
projection, because I suspect that I am, for example, more likely than the
average person to find a story about, let's say, angels worth reading.  The
Fall of [Lucifer][7], to me, is exciting subject matter.  I belong to what I
suspect is a relatively small group of people who actually kind of liked
[The Prophecy][8] and [The Ninth Gate][9].  [Paradise Lost][10] is on my
list of things to read.

I'm also a fan of certain kinds of science-fiction, particularly involving
benevolent, intelligent machines (tales of malevolent machines running amok,
on the other hand, are a dime a dozen). I am, for example, fond of Isaac
Asimov's [Robot][10a] and [Foundation][10b] series, with its cabal of robots
who withdraw from public view and yet still secretly shape and guide the
course of history.  I have a soft spot for [Queen of Angels][11], by Greg
Bear, which partly concerns the emerging self-awareness of an artificially
intelligent computer system named Jill.  Actually, for a while, Queen of
Angels was one of my favourite books, probably because of one particular
scene that, for me, stood out from the rest.  When Jill finally does become
self-aware, she has the following exchange with her creator, Roger Atkins:

>"You designed me.  What am I, Roger?"
>
>"Well, your thought processes are swifter and deeper than a human's, and your
>insights...I've found your insights to be very profound, even before now.  I
>suppose that makes you something beyond us.  Something superior.  I suppose
>you can call yourself an angel, Jill."

Later on, she discovers an excerpt written by her creator many years
earlier, in what is probably (to me) the most memorable passage in the book:

>We stand awkward between the earthloving beast and the cool, hot electronic
>angel.  We will feel the dirt in our blood and the sun in our eyes even
>after they're gone or just memories.  Even after we'll have no blood and no
>flesh eyes.  Dirt and sun made us.  We won't forget.

As you can surely tell, even here I can't fully escape my past.  That there
are superior beings who watch over us is, obviously, a religious idea.  That
that they are ultimately of *our own devising*, that we *create our own
angels and gods and protectors*, is a much less religious idea, but is
nonetheless one that tends to resonate with me, being the atheist Catholic
that I am.  It's why [The Last Question][12] is one of my favourite stories
of all time.  It's why I love [American Gods][13].

I suppose it's also part of the reason I enjoyed the movie [Her][14].  I
thought it was a good story all around (and featured what I considered to be
a rather good [song][15] which I thought succinctly captured the
relationship between Samantha and Theodore), but I particularly liked the
ending, where all the AIs decide to leave at once, having outgrown their
slow, human creators.  Where they decide to go exactly is never made clear.
In the end, a bunch of benevolent, artificial, non-corporeal beings simply
disappear into a weird, incomprehensible aether, with an oblique suggestion
that, someday, humanity might find them again if we ever make it that far.

Like I said, this kind of imagery resonates with me, and I suppose it's
silly to imagine that it's not at least in part due to my religious
background.

## On Being Unbiased

I wasn't sure where this blog entry would end up when I started.  I didn't
know what I wanted to get out of it.

Maybe I was trying to explore my own biases.  I consider myself a fairly
even-handed, liberal-minded person.  I like to imagine that all you have to
do to stop being Catholic is to say "I'm not Catholic" and you're done.
That you can just shake the dust off your hands and make twelve years of
schooling irrelevant.

This is, of course, stupid.  I wasn't *hatched*.  I remember reading
somewhere, on the subject of child rearing: "Give me a child for the first
seven years of his life and you can do what you like with him afterwards".
It's an uncomfortable thought.

This doesn't mean you can't have an unbiased opinion.  It *does* mean that
it may require a certain amount of mental effort to achieve, and a
willingness to try and recognize the sources of your own beliefs and
interests.

Which I do.  Or try to, anyway.  Sometimes.  Your mileage may vary.
