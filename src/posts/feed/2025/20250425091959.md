From what I understand, Dennett's response to the Chinese Room was that we find it unconvincing because we don't think of it in enough detail.

This used to be my position as well, until ChatGPT came along.  Now we have extremely convincing syntax generation, without genuine intentionality behind it.  So I guess I have to believe there's something more to genuine intelligence here.
