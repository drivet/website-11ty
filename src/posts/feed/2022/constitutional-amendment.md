title: Prohibition Was a Constitutional Amendment

It always amazes me to think that Prohibition in the U.S. was implemented
via a Constitutional amendment, as was its repeal.

In my head I think of a Constitution as a country's legal axioms - the
foundation of its law system.  From this perspective it makes sense that the
prohibition of alcohol, having no Constitutional basis, had to be passed by
adding another axiom.  And when people realized that this was just a bad
idea, it makes sense that getting rid of it required adding yet another
axiom.  It's funny, when you think about it, like a big legal "oops!" that
you can't erase.

But it's also intensely disquieting, because it means that you can pass what
amounts to an unconstitutional law just changing the definition of
"constitutional".  Is banning alcohol unconstitutional?  No problem!  Amend
your constitution to allow it.  Oh wait, was that a bad idea?  Also no
problem!  Amend your constitution and erase your mistake!

My greatest fear when Trump became President was that he would find a way
around the two-term limit.  The two-term limit is, after all, a
constitutional amendment.  If you can repeal Prohibition, you can repeal
that.

And this is part of the reason I'm afraid that the days of legal abortion in
the U.S. may be numbered.  Maybe the Supreme Court will strike down Roe
vs. Wade, and maybe that will render the legality of abortion a question to
be decided by individual states.  But that won't be good enough for a lot of
pro-lifers.  For them, presumable, nothing short of a nationwide ban will be
enough.

And if you can ban alcohol nationwide, you can ban abortions nationwide.
