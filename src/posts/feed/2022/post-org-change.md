After some consideration I've decided to remove the articles from my "Posts"
feed and rename it to "Notes".  It now contains just my notes and photos
(and videos if I ever start posting those).  As before, my articles are
available in my "Blog" feed.

Initially, my reason for mixing articles, notes and photos into one "posts"
feed was that I suspected at least some of my readers would want a feed just
for "original content", and the "posts" feed provided that.  I still think
this is true, but some other insights have led me to reconsider the
approach.

* I syndicate to Twitter and Facebook, and if you're reading my stuff from
  one of those services, it doesn't matter where my notes or articles come
  from - they always just show up combined on my profile or wall.

* If you're a bit more tech savvy and you're reading my stuff via [Atom][]
  feeds or a [microsub][] reader, you probably already know how to subscribe
  to multiple feeds at once, and you can therefore still get an "original
  content" feed by subscribing to my notes and blog feeds.
  
Basically, the posts feed was really only useful to people who a) didn't
read my stuff from Twitter or Facebook, and who b) didn't use Atom or
microsub.  For such people, a combined feed of notes, photos and blog
entries *may* have proven useful, but in the end such people can still just
read both feeds separately and be done with it.

The end result is now a bit less weird.  I have:

* A notes feed, like a microblog, for notes and photos.  I maintain that it
  makes sense to combine notes and photos.
* I still have my traditional blog.  This is unlikely to ever change.
* A links feed for my bookmarks,
* The firehose, which contains everything, including likes, reposts, and
  replies.

For people who did actually subscribe to the posts feed, I'll continue to
publish it for the time being, but it's not directly linked from my pages.

I hope this is less confusing.  Thanks for the patience everyone!
