title: French as an Emergent Property
---

In a [previous blog entry][1], I described various solar system simulations
I played around with in high school. These were perhaps more properly termed
"gravity simulations" since what I simulated was not a solar system per se
but rather Newton's laws of gravity and motion as applied to a bunch of
swirling rocks, which would produce a solar system if the conditions were
set up correctly. The orbits that you saw in these programs appeared
naturally out of the math, as emergent properties of the equations - they
were not explicitly programmed.

This is a key feature of the simulation; I did not start out by assuming
that the orbit would be an ellipse, or that there would even be an orbit at
all. Rather, I started from the basics: the laws of gravity and motion, and
saw what came out of them.

I think this is an excellent way to program simulations since you are not
imposing your will on the results and, as a result, the results may surprise
you. In general, the less assumptions you have about how the results will
look the better, since you never know if the results look that way because
you *assumed* they would or because they actually do.  Often your
assumptions affect the result and this is a bad thing.

I originally wrote my blog entry on simulations with the intention of
incorporating my views on Quebec society (well, society in general really,
especially with respect to what should and shouldn't be enshrined in law),
but I found that the entry was getting long enough as it is, and anyway I
found that it was independently interesting (if you like that sort of
thing), so I decided to cut it short and make it a separate posting. But
there was a deeper purpose there. I think that emergent properties are a
good way to think about traits that we normally attribute to a society,
especially its language, culture, and general ambiance.

## Bill 101 and Linguistic Shorthands

I live in Quebec, and we have a law termed Bill 101 - otherwise known as the
Charter of the French Language.  Nominally, it defines French as the
"official language" of Quebec. This sounds fairly innocuous, but like other
terms revolving around touchy political subjects (think "privatization", or
"free trade" or "freedom" or "rights"), the term "official language" can
mean different things to different people.

In many ways Bill 101, in declaring French as Quebec's only official
language, has had the results you'd expect i.e. French is now the language
of Quebec's governmental and legal system.  By extension, since the
government also funds the school system, this has certain implications for
the language used in Quebec's educational institutions, the most obvious one
being that if you want a public education in Quebec, with few exceptions,
you will have to get it in French.

If that's where it ended, with French being declared Quebec's official
"language of bureaucracy", I wouldn't be writing this (or, at least, I'd be
writing something different).  Since it is obviously impractical to
translate every government document into every language under the sun, one
needs to choose a small number of "interface languages" between the
government and its citizens.  And since the majority of Quebec's citizens
speak French, it makes sense to choose French in this capacity.  Even
forcing children to get their education in French could be justifiable
considering that the government is footing the bill (this is just one of the
many issues that crop up when you fund a school system with public money -
many taxpayers are English speaking after all - but that's another
conversation).

(One could argue, of course, that English should also be one of Quebec's
"official languages", since the province sports a sizable 20% anglophone
population and is in any case part of a wider, mostly English speaking
country, but I digress. The government of Quebec is within its rights to
pick a single, everyday language of government, and they've chosen French,
which isn't an insensible choice.  This is fine as far as it goes).

It is unfortunate, therefore, that the architects of Bill 101 seemed to have
a more ... open-ended? ... pervasive? ... all-inclusive?  ... idea of
"official language" in mind when they crafted this law.  Judging by Bill
101's near unanimous support in this province (amongst francophones,
anyway), it appears that most people here agree with the more
all-encompassing concept.

It begins with French being defined as the "official language of commerce"
in Quebec. This is, apparently, part of what it means to be an "official
language".  Declaring French the "official language of commerce" in Quebec
means:

* businesses with more than a certain number of employees must operate in
  French (unfortunately I don't recall the exact number but I believe it's
  between 50-100).  This entails, among other things, holding meetings in
  French, keeping all documentation in French, and answering the phones in
  French.

* employees in a company with more than a certain number of employees must
  demonstrate a sufficient knowledge of the French language.

* the use of French is required on all commercial signs and must be
  "markedly predominant" over anything non-French.

This last one, by the way, was a concession. The original law stated that
French was the *only* language allowed on commercial signs, but this ran
afoul of the Supreme Court, which judged that it was unconstitutional.  The
response in Quebec was to invoke the notwithstanding clause (i.e. "We know
it's unconstitutional, but we don't care") until a compromise could be
worked out. The "French must be the predominant language on the sign" law is
the compromise.

Is any of this a big deal?  Doesn't it make sense, for example, to require
employees to be sufficiently fluent in the majority language of the province
where they work? Doesn't it make sense to require that commercial signs be
in a language that the majority of the population can understand?  The
reality is that, statistically speaking, Quebec is predominantly French.
Shouldn't the laws reflect this fact?

I suspect this family of arguments is how most Bill 101 supporters justify
the law in their heads.  An (anglophone) acquaintance of mine, for example,
tried to spin Bill 101 as nothing more sinister than an anthropological
statement of Quebec's nature as a French speaking province.  Or to put it
another way: he seemed to view it as sort of a passive acknowledgement of a
cultural reality in this province.

Another (francophone) acquaintance of mine, being somewhat more honest with
himself I think, justified Bill 101 with a certain amount of paranoia:
without the Charter, the "ethnics" would take over and we'd all be liable to
walk into a brothel innocently thinking it was a bakery (because, of course,
the sign out front wouldn't be in French, and brothels apparently look like
bakeries from the outside). I didn't push him on the topic, but I suspect if
he had been pressed for a deeper justification of his views he would have
come up with the same sort of rhetoric as my other friend: Quebec is French,
Bill 101 is simply the recognition of that fact, there would be chaos
otherwise, and the rest of you non-French people just have to deal.

Top off the rhetoric with an unspoken but implicit cry of "This is *our*
province" and I think you've pretty much summarized the mindset of a typical
francophone Quebecer with respect to the language laws.  And aside from the
ease with which this can descend into full-blown [nativism][2], I suppose
the problem I have with this kind of thinking boils down to this: *at best*
these laws are useless and *at worst* these laws are autocratic.

It's not hard to make an accurate anthropological statement concerning the
French language in Quebec.  All you have to do is say "French is the
language spoken by the majority of Quebec's citizens" and you're done.  No
need to pass a law.  No need to involve the government at all.  *This* would
be a passive way of acknowledging a cultural reality.

No, Bill 101 is the quite *active* means by which the powers that be in this
province *ensure* that French *remains* the dominant language.  Its
enforcement is analogous to the assumption that your solar system simulation
will always display an elliptical orbit. Once you make that assumption, it
colours the way you construct the simulation. You begin to *expect* an
ellipse on your monitor and if you don't get one, or the math doesn't seem
to be cooperating, you don't ask yourself *why*.  You don't ask if there
might be a good or interesting reason why, for example, you seem to be
getting a parabola instead.  You don't ask why you think an ellipse should
be the right answer in the first place.  Rather you start trying to *force*
an ellipse out of the simulation by fudging the numbers - because, of
course, *an ellipse is the right answer* and if you're not getting one, then
your numbers must be wrong, right?

The lawmakers in Quebec seem to have the same attitude. Quebec is French;
this is the "correct answer", and they must do everything in their power to
maintain the correct answer, right? And if they find certain artifacts that
seem to question the correct answer, things like the existence of largely
non-French areas of Quebec, well those are *anomalies* and they must be
dealt with as such - because we all know what the correct answer is supposed
to look like.

Part of the problem here is the very idea of a province speaking a language.
It's fundamentally incoherent.  Provinces don't speak languages, people do,
though one can, of course, come up with various ways to make the two
concepts fit.  One can assert, for example, that Quebec speaks French if
more than 50% of its citizens speak French - but such contortions, while
useful as linguistic shorthands, run into theoretical difficulties when you
take them literally.  What does it mean, for example, to say that "Quebec is
French" and yet to note that Montreal is approximately 20% anglophone? It's
trivial to reconcile the two statements as long as you remember that when we
say "Quebec is French" we don't *really* mean that the province speaks a
language, or that it acts in a certain way that might possibly be construed
as "French".

This all sounds silly and obvious, I know, but I think alot of people have
trouble seeing past this, sometimes on a subconscious level. It all hinges
on the ordering of cause and effect. When we say something straightforward
like "Quebec is French because more than 50% of its citizens speak French",
we note *first* that "more than 50% of Quebec's citizens speak French", and
*then* note that *because* of this, as a consequence, we can rightly say
that "Quebec is French", if such a designation is deemed necessary.  Bill
101 supporters, on the other hand, have it backwards. They *start* with the
statement "Quebec is French", and rather than treat this as a linguistic
convenience, a simple summary of the demographics of their province, they
instead treat it, on some level, as a kind of literal fact, with various
implications for what kind of social policy should be implemented.

If you insist on doing this you're faced with several dilemmas.
Quebec is French - except, of course, for the people who aren't.  What
should your attitude be toward the people who aren't French?  If all
your citizens already speak French then Bill 101 is useless. But if a
significant segment of your population is non-French, how would you
justify imposing your language on them? How would you justify it,
except to say that Quebec is French, in a manner that is somehow
*independent* of the language and culture its citizens?

What are you supposed to do about the boundary problems that will inevitably
crop up?  Quebec is a big province, both geographically and culturally, and
saying that 60% of the population is francophone tells you exactly nothing
about the demographics of any particular area.  There are some towns in
Quebec that are almost 100% "pur laine" Quebecois and there are some that
are not. Montreal is a partly-French, partly English, and partly everything
else.  Within the company where I work, you have some teams that operate
almost purely in French and some that operate almost purely in English - and
some that occasionally operate in Spanish.  It's hard to pick a social unit
that's small enough to guarantee the sort of unity of culture and language
that would make its codification an indifferent proposition.

None of this is really an issue if you treat statements like "Quebec is
French" as nothing more than a demographic/historical summary, with no real
implications for governmental social policy. One simply looks at the
statistics and sees that, for various reasons, there are several communities
in Quebec that don't speak French, especially in the urban centres, and one
leaves it at that. One doesn't see the existence of these communities as a
threat to some sort of pre-existing, disembodied, entrenched, all-pervasive
provincial Frenchness, because there isn't any. The Frenchness of Quebec, if
it exists, is *derived* from these communities - but only if they actually
speak French. French isn't meant to be *imposed* on them.

And one would see that, once you leave the urban centres, you start to find
areas that are almost 100% French and that in these areas, Bill 101 is
laughable.  Longueuil is French, not because of Bill 101, but simply because
this happens to be the language of the majority.  Rimouski and Lac Saint
Jean are French, for the same reasons. Would things change for these
communities if Bill 101 wasn't around?  It's not uncommon to see commercial
signs in these towns displaying *only* French, to the exclusion of all other
languages.

And that's *fine*.  This isn't a rant about fairness.  French-only signs are
a common sight in Longueuil, and would be irrespective of government fiat,
simply because of its demographics. I would not demand otherwise.  They are
common for the very good reason that most Longueuil residents speak only
French.  So why should West Islanders, the majority of whom speak something
other than French as their native language, be forced to use French on
*their* store fronts? Why should *any* company, if the majority of its
employees speak something other than French, be forced to do so?

The language of a geographical area or social unit, if you wish to define
such a thing, shouldn't be defined from on high with the expectation that
the people in question will simply obey.  Rather, it should be a natural
offshoot of the language the people already speak.  It should be an emergent
property of the interactions of your citizens.  The language of your
province should simply "fall out of the math" of your associated social
fabric.
