title: Comments and Trackbacks Have Been Deactivated
---

When I started this blog, I didn't expect very much in the way of
comments or trackbacks.  I also didn't expect any *spam*, which means
I didn't take any precautions. I mean, how would anybody even *know*
about this blog?

Silly, silly me.

So, I have turned off comments and trackbacks until I figure out a
reasonably reliable way of separating the spam from the ham.  This
will probably entail a bit of a rewrite of YAWT as I figure out a way
to do this in a clean and modular manner.  Why make it easy on myself
when I can make it hard?
