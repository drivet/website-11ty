title: Your Website Is Your Passport
---

One of the themes that crops up again and again in the [IndieWeb][1]
community is that your personal domain, with its attendant website, should
form the nexus of your online existence.  Of course, people can and do
maintain separate profiles on a variety of social media platforms, but these
should be subordinate to the identity represented by your personal website,
which remains everyone's one-stop-shop for all things *you* and the central
hub out of which your other identities radiate.

Part of what this means in practice is that your domain should function as a
kind of universal online passport, allowing you to sign in to various
services and applications simply by entering your personal URL.

This is actually pretty easy to get working on your own website.
Considerably less easy is understanding the underlying protocols and
mechanisms on which it relies.  If that topic interests you, you'll find
much more information in the latter half of this article, presented in a
manner that I hope is not too inaccurate.

## For the Impatient

The simplest (though not the only) way to leverage your website for sign-in
purposes is to delegate the authentication process to an existing social
media profile.

First, add a special "me" anchor tag to your home page detailing where to
find the profile you want to use.  Let's say, for the sake argument, that
you want to use your [Github][2] account.  The link would look like this:

``` html
<a href="https://github.com/drivet" rel="me">Github</a>
```

Note that there is nothing special about this link, aside from the "me"
attribute.  You can use it like any other link on your home page.
Obviously, replace the "drivet" part with your own username.

Next, edit your Github profile so that the website field points back to your
root domain.  You do this to show that you actually control the Github
account to which your homepage is pointing:

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<img border="0"
     src="/static/img/github_profile.jpg" 
     alt="Github profile" />
</div>

Finally, add this link tag to the head of your homepage:

``` html
<head>
    ....
    <link rel="authorization_endpoint" href="https://indieauth.com/auth">
</head>
```

You should now be able to sign in to, for example, a website like
[indieweb.org][1].  You can try it now by going to the site and clicking the
"Log in" link.

You'll be presented with a text box into which you can enter you personal
domain. The service to which you're trying to authenticate
(i.e. indieweb.org) will outsource the process to the authorization_endpoint
link it finds embedded in your homepage.  The particular endpoint we've set
up will look through your homepage and delegate the actual authentication
procedure to the first "me" link it finds.  In our case, we will be asked to
log in to Github, or we will be informed that we are already logged in.
Obviously, if you use this procedure, you are still dependant on an external
service ([indieauth.com][11]) coupled with an existing social networking
profile (Github), which is less than ideal, but at least the authentication
process starts on your own domain, and there are ways to detach yourself
from your external profiles completely if you wish to go that far (see, for
example, the [selfauth][4] project).

Please note that what I've just described is an *authentication* procedure.
It's enough to get you logged in to services which support the protocol.  It
is *not*, by itself, an *authorization* procedure which means you won't be
able to use something like [Quill][13] (a [Micropub][12] client) out of the
box.  For that to work, you need to obtain an access token after
authenticating.  Luckily, that's pretty easy to do as well if you're willing
to rely on an external service.  Just add the following link to the head of
your website:

``` html
<head>
    ....
    <link rel="token_endpoint" href="https://tokens.indieauth.com/token"/>
</head>
```

Once again, if using an external service bothers you, you can host your own
token service.

And that's pretty much it.  Easy, right?

## For the Less Impatient: A Brief Detour Into OAuth-land

The process of using your domain to log in to sites and services is called
[*web sign-in*][14] and is implemented via a protocol called [IndieAuth][5],
an extension of [OAuth][6] used for decentralized authentication.

(When I speak of "OAuth", I refer to OAuth 2, not OAuth 1.  OAuth 1 is
rarely used nowadays, and is therefore not pertinent to this discussion)

The specific process used by the indieauth.com service, whereby it looks for
a rel="me" link on your homepage and then delegates the actual
authentication procedure to that service link, is called [RelMeAuth][19] and
is a popular way to implement IndieAuth, though not the only one.  The
selfauth project, for example, implements a simple self-hosted password
scheme.

Understanding IndieAuth requires a basic knowledge of OAuth, which is a
daunting subject if you've never dealt with it before (and even if you
have).  I'm going to try and give just enough information here to illustrate
where IndieAuth fits into this landscape, but if you want more information I
highly recommend reading the resources at [oauth.com][9]; I find they strike
a good balance of detail, especially if you have a modicum of programming
and HTTP experience.

### What Problem Does OAuth (Not) Solve?

The "auth" in OAuth stands for authorization, not authentication and,
accordingly, OAuth is an authorization protocol, not an authentication
protocol.  What this means is that OAuth is fundamentally about managing
*access* to online resources (like REST APIs) and not about the *identity*
of the user whose resources are being accessed.

The example often given is that of a printing application A that wants
prints photos from a photo sharing application B, where both applications
are managed by different business entities.  In the past, a problem like
this may have been solved by configuring your credentials for B somewhere in
A, but that has several issues, not the least of which is that A now has
full access to your entire account in B, even though all it needs to do is
print out a few photos.

OAuth is designed to help with this problem.  It's meant to allow you to
give applications limited access to resources from another service without
having to give away your full credentials.  It does this by issuing *tokens*
representing the resources the application wishes to access, along with the
actions the application is allowed to take on those resources.

The concept of a token here is not unlike the concept of hotel room access
card.  The access card lets you into your own room, but it doesn't grant you
access to the entire hotel; you can't use it to go into another room, for
example, and you certainly can't use it to go into the staff areas.

### OAuth's Moving Parts

The OAuth [spec][8] defines several actors:

* The *end user*, or the one who owns the resources.  In the above example,
  that would be the person who is trying to print their photos.
* The *client* or the application acting on behalf of the user.  This would
  be the printing application (A) in the above example.
* The *resource service*.  This would be the photo sharing service (B).
* The *authorization server*, existing alongside the resource service.  This
  manages the actual OAuth protocol.  In practice this is almost always
  managed by the same business entity as the resource server, though the
  spec explicitly allows different configurations.

The central idea behind OAuth is that the end user delegates resource access
to the client application, so that the application can access the resources
on the user's behalf.  The final result of this delegation process is the
access token, an opaque string that is meant to be included in the API calls
via the HTTP Authorization header:

<pre>
GET /api/blah
Authorization: Bearer 128728364872
</pre>

Before any of this can take place, the authorization server requires a
priori knowledge of the client attempting to access the resource.  To use
the ongoing example, the authorization server associated with the photo
sharing application (B) needs to know, ahead of time, that the printing
application (A) may be accessing the photos.  This is usually accomplished
via an explicit, out of band client registration step occurring before any
authorization takes place.  Among other things, a client id needs to be
provided so that the authorization server is able to recognize who's asking
for what.

### From Authorization to Authentication

OAuth's access tokens are comparable to hotel access cards and the simile is
a pretty good one.  Your card grants you access to your room, and maybe some
of the common areas, but not the whole hotel; other people's rooms remain
off limits, as do the staff areas.  We could say that the access card
*authorizes* you to enter you room, but not much else.

It's worth noting, however, that *your name and photo are not on the access
card*.  Your access card isn't a piece of identification.  If it were
stolen, the thief would have no trouble ransacking your room.  Someone who
stole, say, your driver's licence, on the other hand, would have a hard time
using it as such because their name and face don't match what's on it.

When we say that OAuth is an authorization protocol rather than an
authentication protocol, this is part of what is meant.

And yet, even so, there are subtleties at play here that are understandably
confusing.  The process of obtaining your hotel access card, for example,
will almost certainly involve an authentication step - you'll probably have
to show, say, your passport or driver's licence to the clerk at front desk.
In the same vein, and pretty much for the same reason, the OAuth protocol
*does* (usually) include one or two authentication steps before the token is
issued.

This leads some people to conclude that plain vanilla OAuth can be used as
an authentication protocol and [they're *almost* right, but not quite][10].
There are several issues with trying to do this, but the main problem is
that authentication protocols are generally expected to produce the identity
of the end-user after the authentication procedure successfully completes
and there is absolutely nothing in the OAuth spec which would allow an
implementation to do this out of the box.  The whole point of the OAuth
process is to obtain an access token, and access tokens are meant to be
opaque strings; there's no standard way to know the identity of the user
involved in the creation of the token.  Indeed, depending on which flavour
of OAuth you use, [tokens may be granted with no end-user authentication at
all][15].

The point is that unvarnished OAuth leaves too many blanks to function as an
authentication protocol on its own.  That being said, it is, of course,
eminently possible to *fill in* those blanks and *create* an authentication
protocol by extending OAuth, but any such extensions would necessarily fall
outside the OAuth spec.

### From OIDC to IndieAuth (Finally!)

The obvious question to ask, at this point, is why no one has created a
*standard* authentication extension to OAuth.  This question has an obvious
answer: of course people have done exactly that!  One of the more well-known
examples is [OpenID Connect (OIDC)][16]; it's the protocol behind all the
"Sign in with Google" buttons sprinkled around the Internet.  It extends
OAuth in many ways, one of which involves defining a standard token format
which can be used to glean information about who's trying to login.

OIDC is very much about authentication and it is very much built on OAuth
but, despite the name, it doesn't actually have that much in common with the
now dead [OpenID][17] protocol.  Typical usage of OIDC requires some kind of
pre-existing arrangement between the service needing sign-in capabilities
and the identity provider.  In other words, the service needs to plaster a
"Sign in with Google" button somewhere on their website.  Those who want to
sign-in with another OIDC provider X won't be able to do so, unless the
application explicitly allows it by adding another "Sign in with X" button.

OpenID, on the other hand, was a portable identity management system and a
truly *decentralized* authentication protocol.  You chose an OpenID
provider, and you were provided with an ID in the form of a URL.  This ID
could be used to log in to services which supported the OpenID protocol,
even if the service didn't know about your OpenID provider beforehand.  The
IDs were also portable; you could change providers without changing ID.  It
was similar in concept to a cell phone number.

Sound familiar?  Sounds a lot like IndieAuth, right?  It's not a
coincidence; IndieAuth is considered something of a spiritual successor to
OpenID.

IndieAuth is built on OAuth but extends it in several ways:

* Client ids and user ids are explicitly defined as resolvable URLs.
* The typical client registration step associated with OAuth is avoided by
  recognizing that client ids and users ids, being resolvable URLs, are
  already implicitly registered in [DNS][20].
* Client and user information are extracted from their respective URLs by
  taking advantage of [microformats][18].
* The specific authorization and token endpoints used in the IndieAuth
  protocol are discovered via the user's homepage, located at the URL
  provided at the start of the process.

IndieAuth is a thin, decentralized identity layer on top of OAuth.  It's
entire reason for being is to answer the simple question: does the person
behind the browser have control over the URL that they are claiming as their
own?

In that sense, IndieAuth is a much more modest protocol than OIDC, whose
scope includes things like session management and standard user profiles.
And yet, being a completely decentralized protocol, it's much more in
keeping with the spirit of the IndieWeb.  If your goal is to make a social
network out of the world wide web, there is a certain elegance to the idea
of leveraging DNS as a user registration system.

## More to Come

This blog entry was much harder to write than I thought it would be.  I tend
to write in order to clarify and solidify my own understanding of a topic
and, in all honesty, I did not find OAuth a particularly easy subject to
grasp.  I do think I have a better handle on it now and I'm going to once
again recommend the resources at [oauth.com][9], especially if you know a
programming language.  They take you through the process of writing a very
simple OAuth server and it's enlightening.

There's a lot more to write about the IndieWeb, and I'm planning on
publishing at least a couple of more blog entries (probably revolving around
webmentions and microformats, but we'll see).  Stay tuned!
