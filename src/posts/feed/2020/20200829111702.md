TIL about the Barbie Liberation Organization who, in 1993, bought up 300-500 talking Barbie and G.I. Joe dolls and switched their voice boxes so the Barbies would say things like "Vengeance is mine" and the G.I. Joes would say things like "The beach is the place for summer". &nbsp;They then returned the dolls to the stores ("reverse shoplifting") to be sold to unsuspecting children.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie_Liberation_Organization
