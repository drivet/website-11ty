title: On Carrots in Tomato Sauce
---

Not long ago, I joined an Italian cooking group on Facebook.  I thought it
would be a good opportunity to pick up some tips and recipes.  I left the
group a couple of months later, after some members became...oh, let's call
it "agitated"...over whether [Sunday ragu][1] was a "sauce" or a "gravy".

It sounds like a joke, doesn't it?  Personal attacks stemming from
disagreements over culinary terminology seem like such a cartoonish Italian
stereotype that you almost think it just *can't* be true.  Or maybe you just
don't want it to be.

I mean, I don't particularly enjoy pineapple on my pizza, but if *you* do my
reaction is generally just to shrug and move on.  My reaction, notably, does
*not* involve calling you a "festering puke" and then telling you to go "die
in a fire".

Okay, I'm exaggerating.  But only *slightly*.

## The Gatekeepers

There's a lot to unpack here, so let's start at the beginning and give some
context.

The motivation for this blog post stems from a recent conversation I had
with a friend of mine.  I live in Montreal, and a standard grocery store
item is a bag of diced, frozen "sauce vegetables" - carrots, celery and
onion.  They're meant to form a base for tomato sauce.  He commented that
these vegetables, though a very common feature of Quebecois life, are about
as Italian as kielbasa.  Authentic Italian tomato sauce, so the story goes,
consists of nothing but tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, basil and salt.

Now, my mother is Italian and, as you might expect, a pretty good cook.  And
it's true - I've never seen my mom add carrot or celery to a tomato sauce.
Her recipe, as a matter of fact, roughly matches my friend's.  But I think
back to that Facebook group and my hackles go up because if there's one
thing that group taught me it's that I have an intense dislike of
gatekeeping, in cooking as in life.  And I suddenly feel like I have to
defend the idea of carrots in tomato sauce, even if my mom would make a face
at the very idea.

## The Authenticity Trap

So...do I actually think that carrots are an appropriate ingredient in
Italian tomato sauces?  Well, I *could* point out that many tomato-based
sauces in Italian cooking start with a [soffrito][2], which consists of
carrots, celery and onions.  These sauces tend to have meat in them, but so
what?  I could also point out these recipes:

<https://mysardinianlife.com/2012/03/20/how-to-make-tomato-sauce-like-an-italian/>

I honestly have no idea how "authentic" these are, but I think the question
is badly framed.  I'm not even really sure what "authentic" is supposed to
mean in this context.  Authentic for whom?  Italy is a big, regional
country, and cooking is a very personal and individual thing.  I'm sure
everybody and their mother has their own way to make tomato sauce, and it
seems a little absurd to think that carrots and celery are simply banned
from the ingredients list.

Also, Italian cooking is extremely rustic, especially when compared to
something like French cooking, which is much more formalized.  It sometimes
feels like a competition to see who can produce the tastiest meal with the
fewest ingredients and, frequently, you end up just making do with what you
have in your pantry.  It's only natural that recipes vary wildly from person
to person and region to region.  Trying to nail down one "authentic"
variation of a dish feels completely anathema.

That's not to say that the notion of authenticity has no place at all - you
probably won't find bok choy or soy sauce in many Italian recipes - but
focusing on it kind of defeats the spirit.  Even something as emblematic as
tomatoes are a fairly recent addition (500 years ago) to the Italian
culinary landscape.  Nothing ever stays the same forever.

## Case In Point

[Marcella Hazan's famous tomato sauce][3] has a grand total of four
ingredients:

- can of tomatoes
- butter
- peeled, halved onion (unchopped)
- salt

You fish out the onion at the end and either throw it out or eat it
separately.  Notably, this sauce it has no garlic, no olive oil and no
spices.  Is it authentic?  Well, Hazan is Italian, so...yes?  Then again, I
ran this recipe by my mother who, as I mentioned, is also Italian, and it
grossed her out.  So...no?  Do you see the problem?

People are sometimes flummoxed by the butter in the sauce, because common
wisdom states that Italian recipes tend not to use butter.  But which
Italian recipes?  From what part of Italy?  Part of the reason that
gatekeeping is a sucker's game when it comes to Italian cooking is because
Italy is such a varied country.  Believe it or not, there are parts of the
country that use butter.  Italians who forget this fact will often sputter
when someone points out that many recipes for Bagna Cauda call for butter as
well.

## On Avoiding the Question

Okay, but...do I actually use carrots in my tomato sauce?

The answer is...sometimes.  I don't generally add them if I'm making simple
sauce.  But I *will* if I'm trying to make something more robust; I live
with a vegetarian, and I'll often make a lentil "bolognese" with a full
soffrito as a base.  Do I care if it's "authentic"?  Not even a little.

And if the haters in that Facebook group don't like it, they can go eat a
wheel of [Cazu marzu][4].  It's *very* authentic.
