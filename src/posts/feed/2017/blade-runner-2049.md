title: Thoughts on Blade Runner 2049
---

I saw [*Blade Runner 2049*][1] recently.  I have some (not very original)
thoughts to share.  Spoilers ahead.

The original [*Blade Runner*][2] only really caught my attention in my adult
years.  Unlike, say, [*Back to the Future*][24],
[*Ferris Bueller's Day Off*][25] and [*Superman*][26], it was not one of my
"childhood movies".  I saw it once when I was very young, found it boring
and weird, and then promptly forgot about it until I was made to watch it
sometime in my 20's or 30's with my eyes fully open.

Once I did, though...wow.  That movie drips atmosphere.  I'd be lying if I
said it's one of my favourite movies of all time - I feel like that kind of
designation is less about the movie itself and more about my frame of mind
at the time I see it - but it's definitely up there as one of the movies I
admire most from a visual standpoint.  It's still beautiful 35 years later.

When I heard that they were making a sequel, I was curious and apprehensive.
When I heard [Denis Villeneuve][3] was directing it, I became less
apprehensive; he also directed [*Arrival*][4] which, though flawed, was
still a surprisingly competent adaptation of [*Story Of Your Life*][5], an
absolutely amazing short story that I had nonetheless written off as
completely unfilmable.

So, how did the *Blade Runner 2049* hold up?  With caveats, the short answer
is that it was pretty darn good and you should see it if you haven't
already.  For the longer answer, read on.

## Zeerust, Everywhere!

If you're not familiar with the term, [zeerust][6] is, to quote Douglas
Adams:

>The particular kind of datedness which afflicts things that were originally
>designed to look futuristic.

Unsurprisingly, science fiction as a genre suffers from zeerust all the
time, and the original *Blade Runner* is no exception.  The movie, released
in 1982, depicts a 2019 filled with button and dial encrusted technology
that whirs and clicks audibly, and where [Pan-Am][7], [Atari][8] and the
[Soviet Union][9] are going concerns.

When faced with the prospect of creating a sequel to such a movie, there is
a strong temptation to wipe the slate clean and start over, to update the
in-universe history and technology to be more in line with present reality.
The [Star Trek][10] franchise is particularly guilty of this.
[Star Trek: Discovery][11] appears to have technology that looks
suspiciously similar to a holodeck, despite taking place 10 years before the
[original series][12], where there was nary a holodeck in sight (and 80
years before [Star Trek: The Next Generation][13], which gave the impression
that the holodeck was a *new* technology). [Star Trek: Enterprise][14] takes
place nearly 100 years before the original series and each episode suffers,
to varying degrees, from [Cosmetically Advanced Prequel][15] syndrome.

So right off the bat, let me just say that *Blade Runner 2049* doesn't do
any of that.  *Blade Runner 2049* positively *wallows* in zeerust, and it's
*beautiful*.  The new movie does not try to retcon the original in any way;
the zeerust is lovingly treated as canon. It's brilliant.

So Pan-Am, Atari, and the Soviet Union are *still* going concerns in 2049 if
their neon and holographic billboards are any indication.  The technology,
though noticeably sleeker, is still clearly descended from the gadgets in
the original movie.  It's still satisfyingly *chunky*.  The flying cars look
like they were inspired by DeLoreans.  The voice commands used to control
the various devices sound vaguely like the sort you'd give to an
[Infocom][28] game.  I read an article which said that the tech in Blade
Runner looks as if it were descended from the [Walkman][16] rather than the
[iPod][17], and truer words were never spoken (not surprising given that
[Sony][18] is one of the backers of the movie).

So, yes, the movie, like its predecessor, is simply gorgeous.  This is a
*luxurious* film.  You can sense the huge amount of thought and effort that
went into the making of it.  And you can sense someone behind the scenes
arranging things just so.  Nothing is there by accident.

## Refrigerators, Everywhere!

With all that being said, the movie does have its flaws.

Some people focus on the film's rather gratuitous nudity in this regard, but
I won't do that since I feel it's a symptom of a bigger problem.  In any
case, I'll note that while naked women parading about on gigantic,
holographic billboards might be an utterly sexist form of advertising, it's
also, unfortunately, a very realistic one and the kind of in-your-face t&a
so prevalent in the world of *Blade Runner 2049* is a simple,
straightforward extrapolation of the kind of advertising one sees today.
The future depicted in this world is not meant to be anything other than
bleak.

No, the film's biggest problem revolves around the use of a trope called
["Women in Refrigerators"][19].  If you're not familiar with the term, it's
basically when a female character, with little or no back story, is
introduced for the sole purpose of being killed off later for the sake of
narrative drama or (invariably male) character growth.

*Blade Runner 2049* makes liberal use of this trope, and it mars the film.
The first example that comes to mind would be the scene near the beginning
where an unnamed female replicant is brought out of stasis, in the nude,
only to be stabbed in the belly a few minutes later, just to make it clear,
in case we had any lingering doubts, that Niander Wallace (the movie's
[Big Bad][20]) is a heartless asshole.  It all seems so bewilderingly
pointless, especially since Wallace manages to demonstrate how much of an
asshole he is in later scenes just fine.  To be honest, it just felt like an
excuse to show off some boobs - and the fact that it ended in a bloodbath
just made it all the more offensive.

The second example that comes to mind is Joi's death.  At the beginning of
the film, she's introduced as the protagonist's holographic AI girlfriend.
Events eventually conspire to make it necessary to store her entire
consciousness onto a rather fragile looking emitter stick.  It was, of
course, blindingly obvious to everyone in the theatre that her days were
numbered as soon as this happened.  No one was shocked when the [Dragon][21]
of the story crushes the emitter later on.  This is the "Woman in
Refrigerator" trope *par excellence* - it felt like that entire subplot was
set up just so that the protagonist could experience grief at Joi's death.

The last example, though, was the worst.  Near the end of the movie, Deckard
is tied to a chair by none other than Niander Wallace (of "I stab my
replicants in the belly and leave them to die in a pool of their own blood
because I care about the human race" fame).  In an effort to show that he
has more to offer than just pain, he trots out a fresh copy of Rachel from
the original film.  From a technical standpoint, it was amazingly
done. Though I knew that it had to have been so, I simply could not tell
that [Sean Young][22]'s 20 year old face had been digitally grafted onto a
completely different body.  From a narrative standpoint, however, it was a
completely wasted exercise since the character is summarily executed when
Deckard refuses her advances.

Seriously, you go to all the trouble to bring such a significant character
back from the dead, just so that you can shoot her in the head a couple of
minutes later?  For no other reason than to make Deckard suffer?  Sean Young
deserved better.

And while we're on the subject, why is it that [Harrison Ford][23] is
allowed to age gracefully in this movie, but Sean Young isn't?  I mean, they
actually went to what I assume is a lot of trouble to CGI her younger face
onto another body instead of just hiring the actress herself, and while I
admire the technical prowess that went into such a feat, it boggles the mind
that it was deemed necessary.

Was there really no way to make an older Rachel work?  Here's a scene I've
been toying with: Deckard is tied to a chair as before, but this time
Wallace brings out an *aged* Rachel, played by a *real* Sean Young, and
offers to implant memories of a full and happy life together if he just
cooperates.  And Deckard is sorely *tempted*.

I think I would have found that more satisfying.

## Final Thoughts

I do have to say that, on the whole, I enjoyed the movie.

As a purely visual work of art, *Blade Runner 2049* is amazing.  If one
watches it in that frame of mind, one won't be disappointed.  It feels very
much like it belongs in the Blade Runner world.  The creative team behind it
deserves major kudos.

But one should not expect anything particularly progressive or
groundbreaking when it comes to plot or characterization.  And that's
disappointing.  I wanted more.

It's weird, but who would have thought that [*Mad Max: Fury Road*][27] would
actually come out ahead in this regard?
