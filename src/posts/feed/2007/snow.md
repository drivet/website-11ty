title: Let It Snow
---

Cheesy title, I'm aware, but Montreal just got something like 30-60 cm
of snow, depending on which weather report you read, and it's
*gorgeous*.

I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building and from up there
it's a bit difficult to see just how much snow we got. I get to the
street level this morning and I see snow banks higher than my waist. I
don't remember having this much snow since I was in primary school,
and I was smaller then so my memories might be playing tricks on me.

I'm sure there's a lesson in all of this about global warming (why is
it that I can't recall snowbanks this high in such a long time?), but
for the moment it's nice. We might just get a white Christmas this
year.
