title: What it Means to Have an Opinion
---

I have strong opinions on certain topics, but unlike some people I know, I
try to justify my opinions (see, for example, my [philosophy
page][1]). Whether I succeed or not is another matter, but I think that the
attempt at justification deserves at least *some* credit. And I've been
known to change my mind if I'm convinced I'm wrong.

I take a somewhat dim view of the idea that all opinions matter, or that no
one is ever wrong. I know at least one or two people who seem offended
whenever anyone tried to point out flaws in their ideas. I think this goes
beyond not being able to handle criticism; they are of the belief that every
opinion has a bit of right in it. I know other people who consider it the
height of rudeness to try and convince another person to change his or her
beliefs. There's a tendency today to treat opinions like an outgrowth of
your body, like a limb, and to equate the desire to change it with the
desire to cut off one's hand. With this sort of attitude, one does not
*debate* so much as *exchange ideas*.

I never understood this stance. Yes, the exchange of ideas is important, but
what's the point of having an opinion if you don't believe said opinion is
the correct one - or, at least, on the right track? I mean, why else would
you have it in the first place? Because you like the colour? And if you
believe that your opinion is at least partially correct, why on earth would
you not try to convince other people?

Note that I said *convince*, not *bludgeon into submission*. Obviously, one
should not force one's opinions on anyone else. By force I mean physically
force - your opinion ends where another person's nose begins. And note also
that an attempt at persuasion does not count as physical force.

This is why I have absolutely no problem with, say, Baptist Christians
passing out flyers saying that non-believers will suffer eternal hellfire,
or Jehovah's Witnesses coming to my door to explain why they think blood
transfusions are evil. These people have a right to their opinions and a
right to evangelize. I, in turn, have the right to consider their beliefs
utterly ludicrous, and to tell them so - bluntly - if I want. If the
conversation turns physical, then there would be a problem, but there would
be a problem with anyone getting coercive in this manner, regardless of the
context.

At the end of the day, it is up to the individual to decide for him or
herself what the truth is. This is not the same as saying that every opinion
has merit, or that there's no such thing as universal truth or
falsehood. It's nothing more than a statement of jurisdiction and jealous
sovereignty over one's own soul.
