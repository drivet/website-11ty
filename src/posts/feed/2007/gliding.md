title: I Don't Even Like Heights
---

Several months back I won a free gliding session with [Vol Recreatif][1] in
a raffle. My natural laziness, combined with my nervousness about heights,
combined with the fact that gliding is only fun if you have good weather,
meant that I only managed to get myself to the airfield this past Saturday
with the help of a friend of mine who actually has a car.

First things first: air gliding is not hand gliding. You are not exposed to
the air. You and a pilot are seated in what looks like a single wheeled
airplane with no engine. You're towed to a certain height by an actual (old,
rickety, propeller-driven) airplane and then released to coast and drift
gently back down. The whole thing takes maybe thirty minutes.

So what was it like?, Well, as I mentioned, heights make me nervous. So I
was nervous. Also, there's nothing to hold onto in the
glider. Roller-coasters also make me nervous, but at least there are
*handle-bars*. I realize they're nothing more than a security blanket, but
still.

It's not like flying in an actual airplane. I feel vaguely safe in an
airplane because it's got an actual motor. Something's whizzing, something's
making noise, *something* is keeping us in the air. A
glider...glides. There's nothing keeping you in the air except the laws of
physics. Yes, I realize that the only thing keeping you in the air with a
passenger jet is the laws of physics (perhaps even more so, considering the
weights involved), but this is all somehow driven home when you're in a
glider. I was slick with sweat and I don't think it was just the heat.

That didn't stop me, however, from snapping some [photos][2] of the event,
for interested parties.
