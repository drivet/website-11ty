title: Markdown Is Cool
---

I'm using [Markdown][1] to write this blog entry. I've converted all my
other entries to use Markdown as well. Markdown is cool.

One of the annoying things about Blosxom (and perhaps other blogging tools)
is the need to write the entries in HTML. Now, I have nothing against HTML
and, as I've [mentioned before][2], I insist on having full control over the
HTML that gets used on my site, especially for layout purposes. But for
writing actual *text*, I find the markup a bit tedious, especially since I
always end up using the same tags over and over again.

The markup in my blog entries consists almost entirely of paragraph,
emphasis, list, and link tags. These tags (with the possible exception
of links) all represent natural artifacts in written language. And
these artifacts all have natural textual representations.

If you wanted to write an essay using nothing but Emacs or Notepad
(i.e. not Word), and you wanted a paragraph break, how would you add
one? The obvious thing to do is to put in an extra newline. How would
you emphasize a word? What *I* do, and it turns out this is very
common, is to put asterisks around the text I'm trying to
emphasize. What if you want a bulleted list? The tendency is to choose
some sort of texual marker, like an asterisk or a dash, and prepend it
to your list item.

This is where Markdown comes in. Markdown will convert all those
natural typographic conventions into their HTML equivalent so that
they get displayed properly in a web browser, allowing you to write
your content in (what I consider to be) a natural way. And while I
normally abhor auto-generated HTML, the HTML that Markdown generates
is so light and so close to what I would normally write anyway, that I
can comfortably relinquish control in this particular instance.
