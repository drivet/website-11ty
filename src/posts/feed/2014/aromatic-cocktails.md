title: Meditations on the Aromatic Cocktail
---

David Embury classifies cocktails into two distinct groups: sour cocktails
and aromatic cocktails. I've [written][1] in the past about
[sour cocktails][2] but have been mostly silent about aromatic ones.

Until NOW, that is! It was an omission that just had to be rectified.
Right? RIGHT?!

Aromatic cocktails are flavoured by some kind of aromatic wine, spirit, or
bitters. Based on my (limited) experiments, I broadly categorize these
drinks into:

 * Old Fashioned Cocktails
 * Liqueur or wine based Cocktails

But really, there's no real rule here.  You basically take a base spirit and
you flavour it with some combination of flavouring agent(s). Pretty simple.

## Old Fashioned Cocktails

The conventional Old Fashioned contains:
 
 * bourbon
 * sugar
 * angostura bitters

with an optional splash of soda water.  The exact proportions, as always,
vary from person to person.  The point is that the modern recipe for an Old
Fashioned usually uses some kind of whiskey (often bourbon, but sometimes
rye, or Canadian).

Now, it *used* to be the case (going way back) that the term "cocktail"
referred to a specific *family* of drinks, namely sugar-sweetened spirits
with bitters added (sugar sweetened spirits were called "slings"; adding
bitters transformed them into "cocktails").  As more complex drinks were
invented, these simpler drinks came to be known as "Old Fashioned
Cocktails".  It's worth noting that whiskey wasn't the only kind of spirit
used for these drinks - gin was another popular choice.

So that's how I prefer to think of Old Fashioned Cocktails - they're a class
of drinks, rather than a specific cocktail made with whiskey.  My preferred
generic recipe for such an Old Fashioned is:

 * 6 cl spirit
 * 1 teaspoon sugar(-like) syrup (or equivalent amount)
 * 3-4 dashes bitters

Pour the sugar into a glass, add the bitters, add the ice, then add half the
alcohol. Mix, and then add the rest of the alcohol.

The recipe calls for sugar(-like) syrup or equivalent amount.  The
"equivalence" here refers to equivalence in sweetness - some sweeteners are
sweeter than others.

As mentioned, nowadays the traditional choice for the spirit is bourbon, and
the traditional choice for the bitters is angostura.  That being said, you
are not limited to whiskey; you can make a Gin Old Fashioned, a Brandy Old
Fashioned, a Cognac Old Fashioned, etc. (in some parts of the U.S. a
standard Old Fashioned is actually made with brandy, not whiskey).  You can
vary the bitters.  One popular choice is orange bitters instead of angostura
in a traditional whiskey Old Fashioned.  You can also vary the sweetener (as
long as it's sugar based).  I'm pretty sure the purists will yell at me at
this point and say that what you have then is *not* an Old Fashioned and
they're probably right, technically, but thinking this way makes things
easier to categorize in my head.

For example, here's a rather good recipe for a Tequila Old Fashioned:

 * 6 cl 100% Blue Agave Tequila.  Aged ones are better in this drink.
 * 1/2 teaspoon agave syrup
 * 3-4 dashes orange bitters

Agave syrup is about twice as sweet as sugar, so you need less here.

Here's one for a Calvados Old Fashioned:

 * 6 cl Calvados
 * 1 teaspoon pure maple syrup
 * 3-4 dashes angostura bitters

The sweetener is maple syrup because, you know, why not?

## Liqueur or Wine Based Cocktails

These cocktails are usually duos, i.e. a spirit and an aromatic liqueur, but
you can use any combination of flavouring agents you want.  The ratio I tend
to prefer is:

 * 6 cl spirit
 * 2 cl flavouring agent (usually some kind of liqueur)
 * (optionally) a few dashes of bitters

Depending on my mood, I'll increase the ratio of liqueur.  It depends on how
much I like the base spirit, and how much I like the liqueur.  A little
creme de menthe, for example, goes a *very* long way.

There are several drinks in this category:

 * Martini (gin and dry vermouth)
 * Manhattan (whiskey and sweet vermouth)
 * Rob Roy (scotch and sweet vermouth)
 * Stinger (brandy and creme de menthe)
 * Rusty Nail (scotch and Drambuie)
 * Italian Heather (scotch and Galliano)
 * Godfather (scotch and amaretto)

There are many, many others, of course.

## How Much Vermouth?

According to the ratio above my Martini recipe looks like this:

 * 6 cl gin
 * 2 cl dry (white) vermouth
 * 2 dashes orange bitters

My garnish of choice is a brine coated olive in the glass.  This technically
makes this a lightly dirty Martini, which some people don't like.  You can
rinse the olive if you hate the salt.

This is a 3-1 ratio of gin to vermouth, and some people will recoil in
horror.  Modern day recipes tend to use just a dash or a few drops of
vermouth, but can I just share an opinion here?  This is silly.  I can
barely taste the vermouth at a 3-1 ratio, and I think that people who just
coat the ice with the vermouth before throwing it out are kidding
themselves; what they have in that case is just a shot of cold gin.  Which
is fine if you like cold gin with an olive, but then why bother with the
vermouth at all?  Do like Winston Churchill and just wave the glass in the
general direction of Italy.

Interesting side note about Martinis: as mixed today, Martinis are almost
always "Dry Martinis" and people often think that the term "dry" in this
case comes from the amount of vermouth used in the drink; "dry" means a
small amount of vermouth and "wet" means a relatively large amount of
vermouth. Actually, however, the term "dry" refers to the use of dry vermouth
(as opposed to sweet), not the amount of vermouth used - the implication
being that it's possible to have a "Sweet Martini", made with sweet
vermouth. I've tried such a beast, and it isn't bad, but modern palates tend
to prefer the dry version, and so that's what you get by default.

It's a similar story with the Manhattan. Manhattans today are almost always
*Sweet* Manhattans, but it's possible to make a dry version, with dry
vermouth. Like the sweet Martini, however, few people seem to like this
version - though Frank Sinatra is said to have loved them.

As for the bitters, they are optional, but I find they add a nice smell.

By now you can probably guess my Manhattan recipe:

 * 6 cl bourbon
 * 2 cl sweet (red) vermouth
 * 3-4 dashes angostura bitters or Fee brothers Old Fashioned Bitters.

Again, this a pretty high ratio of vermouth, but even at that concentration, I
find it just adds a bit of sweetness, and I can barely tell that it's
vermouth at all.
