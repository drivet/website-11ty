message: "Back then, I believed healthcare worked like clockwork. Doctors give you pills — nobody asks “what’s really happening?”. It felt safe. Then cracks began to show. \r\nFirst came the fatigue. I blamed my job. And deep down, I knew something was off. I watched people talk about their own experiences. No one had warned me about interactions. \r\n<a href=\"https://www.cowboysrideforfree.com/users/kamagra_\">kamagra side effects</a> \r\nIt finally hit me: one dose doesn’t fit all. Two people can take the same pill and walk away with different futures. Side effects hide. Still we trust too easily. \r\nNow I pay attention. Not because I’m paranoid. I challenge assumptions. Not all doctors love that. This is self-respect, not defiance. The lesson that stuck most, it would be keyword."
