message: "Concerning the food, I'd heard similar comments on a travel podcast recently, and the Spanish guest said you can't just go to Spain and expect good paella everywhere. It's very much a regional thing, each area good at their local food. Paella is supposed to be excellent around Valencia, but don't expect it to be top quality in other parts.\r\nIt's like expecting good poutine in Winnipeg, or a New York slice in Texas. You can probably find it, sure, but it won't be memorable. Not for the right reasons, at least..."
