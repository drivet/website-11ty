A treatment plan is formulated and executed — this dynamic has been a cornerstone of modern medicine. This model, while efficient, overlooks critical variables. \r\nThe clinical picture, however, is frequently complicated by comorbidities. One begins to note a prevalence of treatment-resistant cases. These can range from persistent subclinical fatigue to cognitive disturbances.

Always seek the advice of your physician or another qualified health professional with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition."
