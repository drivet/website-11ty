  Desmond, I appreciate this post and agree with your points. How could one ever
  conceptualize a state of free will where it is unaffected by past occurrences
  - where it is the true first cause? The only definition of free will which
  makes sense in a world where the past constantly influences our decisions is
  one positing that free will is the human ability to evaluate our past
  experience and current character, and then to act in accordance with those
  experiences and character.
