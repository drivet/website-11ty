message: "This post gives me feelings of regret for not maintaining my own blog over the years. If I’d had one, it would contain all the long form thoughts I’ve shared in various places, photo galleries, technical posts that I posted _somewhere_, text versions of talks … now I’m thinking I should start an archiving project \U0001F605. I could wrote about it: scraping together my digital history in the fall of the capitalist social web.\r\n\r\nps: what happened to the Life in Quebec post? I was thinking about why Quebec stays in Canada just before reading this as I was brushing my teeth. (My brain went there as I was thinking about Taiwan …). ANYWAY, that link is dead."
