title: 'Jaffa Cakes for North Americans: an Odyssey'

Evelyn and I found a polish bakery in Point St Charles. One of the things we
saw (aside from the actual pastries) were packages of [Jaffa cakes][1] for
sale. I'd never had one before, but they looked good, so I bought
one. Indeed, they're pretty awesome.  They consist of a sponge-like base,
with orange jelly and chocolate on top.

A friend of mine referred me to a [web site][2] that showed how to make
them.  It claimed that the process was dead easy but that's a
lie. Specifically, I had a difficult time making what British people call
"jelly".

To a Brit, "jelly" is what a North American would call "jello".  So when a
Jaffa cake recipe calls for orange jelly, what they're really calling for
isn't the stuff that you spread on toast, but rather the stuff that you eat
for dessert. This is an important distinction - one that I was aware of,
thankfully, before I started on this odyssey.

Another important point is that jelly or jello apparently isn't made the
same way in the U.K as it is over here.  Jelly, in the U.K. seems to come in
boxes of concentrated cubes, kind of like soup boullion.  The Jaffa cake
recipe called for preparing one of these boxes of jelly with half the
recommended amount of water.

I can only assume that jelly in the U.K. is alot firmer then the equivalent
dessert over here because when I tried this procedure with North American
jello, the result was *still* a gloopy mess that disintegrated at the
slightest heat - like, to pick an example out of thin air, the heat from a
dollop of melted chocolate that you might put on top.

The sponge bases turned out pretty awful too, as they didn't rise even a
*little*. In the end, my first attempt at making Jaffe cakes could be called
a complete disaster - flat, dense, eggy, chewey bases drenched in gloopy, runny
jello, with chocolate on top.

But I would not be deterred. Read on to find out how to make a proper jaffa
cake.

After looking over what I did, I came to the conclusion that I basically did
*everything* wrong.  No, really - at almost every single point where I had
to make a choice as to whether something should be done this way or that
way, I zigged where I should have zagged.

I used cold eggs on the sponge bases, for example, and they didn't have
nearly enough air in them. Here, I should have known better; I've made pound
cake lots of times, without baking powder, and the only way to get it to
rise is to beat a lot of air into the batter before baking. In practice,
I've done this by separating the egg whites from the yolks, beating the
whites into a meringue, and then folding them back into the yolks. This is
*much* easier to do with room temperature eggs. I did this with the sponge
batter and *voila* - proper, light, cakey disks.

For the orange jelly, I opted to make my own: 

 * 1 cup of fresh orange juice
 * 1/2 cup of sugar
 * 1 teaspoon of citric acid
 * 2 packets Knox gelatin

The box of Knox said that one packet of the stuff would set two cups of
liquid. Remembering how my first attempt turned out, I took no chances.  For
my 1 cup of juice mixture, I used two full packets of gelatin. Once the
stuff was set in the fridge, I wouldn't *exactly* have said that it was the
consistency of gummi bears...but it was well on its way.

Anyway, this jelly could totally withstand the heat from the melted
chocolate.  The end result looked like this:

I probably could have clean up the edges a bit, but didn't bother. Also, the
jelly itself softened considerably at room temperature.  These were actually
pretty good. It would be hard for them not to be.  I mean, cake, chocolate,
orange, what's not to like? I admit, they're not quite as good as store
bought Jaffa cakes, but they're an acceptable substitute. Evelyn put it
succinctly: they tasted "homemade".
