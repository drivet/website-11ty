title: In Defence of the Dark
---

I'm addicted to a site called [tvtropes.org][1].  It's basically a catalogue
of various literary and artistic devices used in various forms of media
(books, movies, TV).  It's fun because the site gives names to practices
that you already recognize but haven't bothered to identify in any specific
way.  Examples include [Genre Blindness][2], which explains the tendency of
Bond villains to reveal their entire master plan to the spy rather than just
shooting him, and [Lampshading][3], which is an attempt to diffuse an
obvious plot hole by having a character draw attention to it.

Another one of these articles is called ["Darker and Edgier"][4], which
describes a "a Tone Shift that seeks to make a work of fiction 'more
adult'."  This should be familiar to anyone who has seen a recent superhero
or science fiction movie. Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, for
example, is a grittier version of Tim Burton's Batman - which is itself a
*much* grittier version of the awesome campfest that was the 1960's Batman
TV show.  Battlestar Galactica is another notorious example - it's a remake
of the campy 1970's TV show and is, at times, *extremely* depressing.

Some people like these tone shifts, others don't. There is a certain kind of
person who enjoys the campiness of the original Batman, and who does not
think that the extreme angst of the new Battlestar Galactica counts as
entertainment.  That being said, I think most people *do* like the newer
stuff better - a Batman movie similar in tone to the [1966 version][5] would
not, I suspect, have done nearly as well as [Batman Begins][6]).

Myself, I think I'm somewhere in the middle.  I think that angst for the
sake of angst is silly, but at the same time I think that people sometimes
confuse "more realistic" and "more naturalistic" for "darker".  I don't
think they're the same thing, though they're often conflated.

For example, beyond a certain aesthetic that made the movie *literally* dark
in colour, I don't actually consider Batman Begins to be a particularly dark
movie in *tone*.  The hero wins out in the end and the bad guys are
defeated.  What the movie *did* try to do was to make the character of
Batman semi-plausible.  The movie tries to answer certain questions about
the character that most interpretations ignore.  Why did Bruce Wayne become
a costumed vigilante rather than D.A. or a police officer?  Where did train?
Where did he get his equipment?  Why did he choose a bat as his personal
symbol?

It goes further than that. The movie shows Batman getting hurt on numerous
occasions. His expertise at martial arts, while impressive, isn't over the
top. The cumulative effect is that Christopher Nolan's Batman is very much
a three dimensional human being - more so than any other interpretation I
can think of.

From what I can see in the trailer, the new Superman movie, [Man of
Steel][7], has a similar kind of vibe. To be sure, Superman isn't a
*realistic* character, but the movie seems to be going to some length to
make everything else around him seem real.  Like Batman Begins, the movie
seems to be asking questions that other interpretations gloss over. How does
a real, honest-to-goodness superpowered alien manage to keep sane when he
can hear *everything*?  How would the world react to his existence?  Nobody
really knows, but prepping the military for an extraterrestrial invasion
doesn't seem too far off the mark.

Some people take issue with this trend. One guy I work with, for example, is
vagely irritated that James Bond in Skyfall is given a (relatively sparse)
backstory. He's not interested in making his heroes more human. His heroes
are abstract, and beyond the reach of mere distractions like backstory.

I, on the other hand, *like* this trend. I'm one of those guys who thinks
that emphasizing a hero's humanity enhances his or her heroism rather
detracts from it.  One has a hard time relating to a mere abstraction.  But
when the hero is a three dimensional human being, when you can relate to him
(or her), you have a greater sense that this kind of heroism is possible.
One doesn't believe that Tim Burton's Batman is real.  One could believe,
for a split second, that Christopher Nolan's Batman is real, and that makes
all the difference.

Of course, if you want *dark* - truly dark, as opposed to just realistic -
well, there are plenty of examples of that too.  The reboot of Battlestar
Galactica is *exceptionally* dark, as befitting the subject matter
(virtually the entire is human race wiped out, with the survivors being
doggedly and ruthlessly pursude by the parties responsible).  [Watchmen][8]
is another example - with scenes including a pregnant woman being gunned
down and New York City being destroyed, you know what kind of movie you're
in for.  [The Walking Dead][9] is pretty depressing, which isn't surprising
considering that it's about a zombie apocalypse.  If you want a
non-comic-book example, the original French version of [The Vanishing][10]
is true [high octane nightmare fuel][11].

And if your beef is with *that* kind of entertainment well, then, I can
relate.  Battlestar Galactica is a very well put together show, but it's not
something I could ever watch more than once.  I felt crappy for several days
after watching The Vanishing. All things considered, I *do* find that
writers sometimes try to out-angst each other, to my occasional chagrin.

It's just that I don't lump the recent crop of naturalistic, believable
movies into that category.  Your mileage, of course, may vary.  Hey, there's
always [The Avengers][12]! :-)
