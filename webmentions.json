        "html": "<p>If you've read my <a href=\"https://desmondrivet.com/tags/indieweb\">previous articles</a> on the <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/\">IndieWeb</a>, you might be\nforgiven for thinking that its members are, by and large, loners who keep to\nthemselves.</p>\n<p>Consider the concept of a \"like\", for example.  On a site like Twitter, a\nlike is an <em>action</em> you perform against another person's content; you click\nthe heart icon next to someone's tweet, and the like counter for that tweet\ngoes up.  It's an implicit connection between two people - the one who did\nthe liking and the one who received it.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/like\">IndieWeb \"like\"</a>, on the other hand, is not an action you perform on\nsomeone's content, but rather a standalone post that you <em>own</em> and publish\nto your site.  It's a reversal of the way people usually think about the\ntransaction, and it reflects the premium IndieWeb members place on\ncontrolling their own content.</p>\n<p>Notably, in the simplest version of this scheme, the person who's post was\nliked - the likee, I guess? - might not even be aware that anything has\nhappened at all.  I mean, how would they?  The entire interaction was wholly\ncontained on another site.</p>\n<p>Which is all well and good but also a little...boring? Calling the IndieWeb\na \"social network\" seems like a bit of stretch when you don't even know how\nmany people liked your post.  What's the point of it all if you don't get to\nsee a little heart counter going up?</p>\n<p>The problem becomes more obvious when one realizes that the IndieWeb does\nnot prescribe the use of any particular blogging software or, indeed, any\nparticular publishing technology at all (other than the standard machinery\nof the web, like HTTP, HTML and CSS), so how exactly would one be able to\neven recognize that a piece of content on someone's website was a \"post\"\nthat could be \"replied to\" or \"liked\" at all?</p>\n<p>Of course, we wouldn't get very far if the IndieWeb community didn't have\nanswers to these questions.</p>\n<h2>How To Build a Decentralized Social Network</h2>\n<p>It's been said that the IndieWeb is what a social network looks like when\nit's built on top of the web itself, but what exactly does this mean?</p>\n<p>If you're a software developer, you've heard of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer\">REST</a>.  It's a software\narchitecture style defined in terms of distributed <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/representative_h-card\">web resources</a>\n(uniquely identified by URLs) and a small number of predefined actions or\nverbs that can be applied to those web resources - the same verbs, not\ncoincidentally, defined by HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc).  The REST\nstyle is used extensively to provide access to distributed web-based data\nresources, often formatted as JSON.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Fielding\">Roy Fielding</a> is usually credited as the person who \"invented\" REST, but\nthat's not quite true.  It would be more accurate to say that he documented\na pre-existing architecture style - namely the one used by the classic world\nwide web.  The entire web is the prototypical REST system <em>par excellence</em>\nin this formulation, with hyperlinked HTML documents being the prototypical\nweb resources.</p>\n<p>I'm not personally accustomed to viewing the web in this fashion, because\nI'm more accustomed to thinking of RESTful services as providing access to\ndata resources, not HTML pages, and I would argue that the distinction is\nmore than just semantics.  Data resources, in my mind, have a regular,\npredictable structure that HTML pages lack.  Data resources represent things\nlike books and appointments and people and blog posts while HTML pages are\njust...pages.  They are primarily meant to be rendered in a browser and\nviewed by human beings and extracting any kind of structured data from them,\nwhile not impossible, tends to be tricky.</p>\n<p>And this puts the IndieWeb in a bit of bind.  The IndieWeb's basic unit of\ncommunication is the post and posts live on websites and websites consist of\nHTML pages and HTML pages, as I've already said, are not structured data\nresources.  So, how does one (programatically) extract a post from a website\nthat one has never visited before?  How does one distinguish notes from\narticles and likes?  These are questions that are readily answered if you're\ndesigning a private, walled social network, because you get to design the\ndata resources from the ground up.  You get to decide what a post looks\nlike, and the web resources involved in modelling one.  It's a lot harder to\ndo when you have to somehow extract that information in a predictable manner\nfrom the chaotic tag soup that forms the majority of personal websites.</p>\n<h2>Enter Microformats</h2>\n<p>So what can you do?  What exactly <em>does</em> a post look like on the IndieWeb?\nFinally we come to the answer, and it requires knowledge about a subject\ncalled <em><a href=\"https://indieweb.org/microformats\">microformats</a></em>.</p>\n<p>Microformats are basically just specialized CSS classes added to your HTML\ncontent in order to give consumers some idea of what that content\nrepresents.  They are effectively the API of the IndieWeb.  Different kinds\nof posts can be represented with different combinations of microformats.</p>\n<p>A standard blog entry (an <em><a href=\"https://indieweb.org/article\">article</a></em>, in IndieWeb parlance), might look\nlike this, for example:</p>\n<pre><span></span><span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>\"h-entry\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n    <span>&lt;h1</span> <span>class=</span><span>\"p-name\"</span><span>&gt;</span>Awesome Title<span>&lt;h1&gt;</span>\n    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>\"e-content\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n        This is a pretty good blog entry\n    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>\n<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>The \"<a href=\"https://indieweb.org/h-entry\">h-entry</a>\" CSS class identifies the whole div as a generic post.\nThe \"p-name\" class identifies the h1 tag as the title of the post and the\n\"e-content\" class represents the article content itself.  We know this is a\n<em>blog entry</em> because of the title; blog entries are really nothing more then\nself-contained, standalone pieces of content with titles.</p>\n<p>(If you're curious about why microformat classes start with a certain\nletter, like h or p, you should read the <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2\">standard</a>.  The specifics,\nwhile interesting, are not germane to this discussion).</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/note\">note</a> (the IndieWeb equivalent of a tweet) looks more or less the\nsame as an article, but lacks a title:</p>\n<pre><span></span><span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>\"h-entry\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>\"e-content\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n        This is a pretty good note\n    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>\n<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>IndieWeb <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/reply\">reply</a> posts are basically just notes with extra information\nto give the reply some context:</p>\n<pre><span></span><span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>\"h-entry\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n    <span>&lt;a</span> <span>class=</span><span>\"u-in-reply-to\"</span> <span>href=</span><span>\"http://elsewhere.com/posts/1234\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>\"e-content\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n        This is a pretty good reply\n    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>\n<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>Note the telltale \"u-in-reply-to\" URL, which identifies this post as a\nreply, and points to the post that this reply is about.</p>\n<p>An IndieWeb like is very similar to an IndieWeb reply, but uses the\n\"u-like-of\" class instead of the \"u-in-reply-to\" class:</p>\n<pre><span></span><span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>\"h-entry\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n    <span>&lt;a</span> <span>class=</span><span>\"u-like-of\"</span> <span>href=</span><span>\"http://elsewhere.com/posts/1234\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>\"e-content\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n        This is a pretty good like\n    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>\n<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>Though likes can contain content of their own, they often don't, so they can\noften be as simple as this:</p>\n<pre><span></span><span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>\"h-entry\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n    <span>&lt;a</span> <span>class=</span><span>\"u-like-of\"</span> <span>href=</span><span>\"http://elsewhere.com/posts/1234\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>\n</pre>\n\n\n<h2>From Microformats to JSON</h2>\n<p>Once you embed your posts with microformats, how does a 3rd party make use\nof the information?  They do it with a <em>microformat parser</em>.  Microformat\nparsers function by reading the special microformat classes from an HTML\ndocument and producing a canonical JSON representation of the extracted\ndata.  So, for example, this markup:</p>\n<pre><span></span><span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>\"h-entry\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n    <span>&lt;h1</span> <span>class=</span><span>\"p-name\"</span><span>&gt;</span>Awesome Title<span>&lt;h1&gt;</span>\n    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>\"e-content\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n        This is a pretty good blog entry\n    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>\n<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>will produce this JSON:</p>\n<pre><span></span><span>{</span>\n  <span>\"items\"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>\n    <span>{</span>\n      <span>\"type\"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>\n        <span>\"h-entry\"</span>\n      <span>],</span>\n      <span>\"properties\"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>\n        <span>\"name\"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>\n          <span>\"Awesome Title\"</span>\n        <span>],</span>\n        <span>\"content\"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>\n          <span>{</span>\n            <span>\"value\"</span><span>:</span> <span>\"This is a pretty good blog entry\"</span><span>,</span>\n          <span>}</span>\n        <span>]</span>\n      <span>}</span>\n    <span>}</span>\n  <span>]</span>\n<span>}</span>\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>according to rules defined by the standard.</p>\n<p>Bear in mind that any HTML element without an associated microformatted\nclass is effectively ignored by a microformat parser, so a post that looks\nlike this:</p>\n<pre><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>article</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>\"</span><span>h-entry</span><span>\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n    <span>&lt;</span><span>div</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>\"</span><span>something-weird</span><span>\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n        <span>This</span> <span>isn</span><span>'</span><span>t really part of the content</span>\n    <span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>\n    <span>&lt;</span><span>h1</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>\"</span><span>p-name</span><span>\"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Awesome</span> <span>Title</span><span>&lt;</span><span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span>\n    <span>&lt;</span><span>span</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>\"</span><span>wrap</span><span>\"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Something</span> <span>else</span> <span>here</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;</span>\n    <span>&lt;</span><span>div</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>\"</span><span>e-content</span><span>\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n        <span>This</span> <span>is</span> <span>a</span> <span>pretty</span> <span>good</span> <span>blog</span> <span>entry</span>\n    <span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>\n    <span>&lt;</span><span>footer</span><span>&gt;</span>\n       <span>This</span> <span>is</span> <span>an</span> <span>awesome</span> <span>footer</span>\n    <span>&lt;/</span><span>footer</span><span>&gt;</span>\n<span>&lt;/</span><span>article</span><span>&gt;</span>\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>will produce exactly the same JSON as the post above.</p>\n<p>In other words, microformats are basically a way of embedding structured\ndata into an unstructured HTML page.  Effectively, microformats allow a\nvanilla, free form personal website to double as a RESTful data service.</p>\n<p>I'll say this again, because I think it's kind of cool: <em>microformats\ntransform a plain, vanilla, HTML-based personal website into a RESTful data\nservice</em>.</p>\n<p>I feel like Roy Fielding would be proud.</p>\n<h2>Counting Hearts</h2>\n<p>The process of liking a post on the IndieWeb, as I alluded to before, might\nseem like a very one-sided activity.  The liker publishes a special post on\ntheir own site which represents the \"like\" and that's pretty much that.  The\nlikee isn't really involved in the procedure.</p>\n<p>Except, of course, that if this were actually true, the IndieWeb web\nwouldn't be much of a social network.  So how exactly do you know how many\npeople liked your post?</p>\n<p>The answer involves a concept called <em><a href=\"https://indieweb.org/Webmention\">webmentions</a></em>.  A webmention is a\nway of notifying a website that another website has linked to it in some\nfashion.  The basic operation is as follows:</p>\n<ul><li>Bob writes an article which links to an article on Alice's website.</li>\n<li>Bob publishes his article, and he (or the software he uses) sends a\n  webmention to an endpoint on Alice's domain, informing her that her\n  article was mentioned in Bob's post.</li>\n<li>Alice's endpoint does something with this information (perhaps recording\n  the fact in a database, for example).</li>\n</ul><p>The webmention protocol is remarkably spare; the payload basically contains\nnothing but the source URL (doing the mentioning) and the target URL (being\nmentioned).  Notably absent is any sort of information about what kind of\npost is doing the mentioning.  Bob's post could have liked Alice's article,\nor it could have replied to it, or it could have just randomly linked to it;\nthe webmention payload is silent on the subject.</p>\n<p>Information about the post which sent the webmention must obtained by\nactually <em>reading</em> the post via the source URL, parsing its microformats,\nand confirming that the target URL actually appears somewhere in its\ncontents.  These extra steps function as form of validation; a valid\nwebmention <em>must</em> be backed by a real, published post or it will be\nsummarily rejected.  This step also allows the consumer of the source post\nto classify it according to its microformats.

        "text": "If you've read my previous articles on the IndieWeb, you might be\nforgiven for thinking that its members are, by and large, loners who keep to\nthemselves.\nConsider the concept of a \"like\", for example.  On a site like Twitter, a\nlike is an action you perform against another person's content; you click\nthe heart icon next to someone's tweet, and the like counter for that tweet\ngoes up.  It's an implicit connection between two people - the one who did\nthe liking and the one who received it.\nAn IndieWeb \"like\", on the other hand, is not an action you perform on\nsomeone's content, but rather a standalone post that you own and publish\nto your site.  It's a reversal of the way people usually think about the\ntransaction, and it reflects the premium IndieWeb members place on\ncontrolling their own content.\nNotably, in the simplest version of this scheme, the person who's post was\nliked - the likee, I guess? - might not even be aware that anything has\nhappened at all.  I mean, how would they?  The entire interaction was wholly\ncontained on another site.\nWhich is all well and good but also a little...boring? Calling the IndieWeb\na \"social network\" seems like a bit of stretch when you don't even know how\nmany people liked your post.  What's the point of it all if you don't get to\nsee a little heart counter going up?\nThe problem becomes more obvious when one realizes that the IndieWeb does\nnot prescribe the use of any particular blogging software or, indeed, any\nparticular publishing technology at all (other than the standard machinery\nof the web, like HTTP, HTML and CSS), so how exactly would one be able to\neven recognize that a piece of content on someone's website was a \"post\"\nthat could be \"replied to\" or \"liked\" at all?\nOf course, we wouldn't get very far if the IndieWeb community didn't have\nanswers to these questions.\nHow To Build a Decentralized Social Network\nIt's been said that the IndieWeb is what a social network looks like when\nit's built on top of the web itself, but what exactly does this mean?\nIf you're a software developer, you've heard of REST.  It's a software\narchitecture style defined in terms of distributed web resources\n(uniquely identified by URLs) and a small number of predefined actions or\nverbs that can be applied to those web resources - the same verbs, not\ncoincidentally, defined by HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc).  The REST\nstyle is used extensively to provide access to distributed web-based data\nresources, often formatted as JSON.\nRoy Fielding is usually credited as the person who \"invented\" REST, but\nthat's not quite true.  It would be more accurate to say that he documented\na pre-existing architecture style - namely the one used by the classic world\nwide web.  The entire web is the prototypical REST system par excellence\nin this formulation, with hyperlinked HTML documents being the prototypical\nweb resources.\nI'm not personally accustomed to viewing the web in this fashion, because\nI'm more accustomed to thinking of RESTful services as providing access to\ndata resources, not HTML pages, and I would argue that the distinction is\nmore than just semantics.  Data resources, in my mind, have a regular,\npredictable structure that HTML pages lack.  Data resources represent things\nlike books and appointments and people and blog posts while HTML pages are\njust...pages.  They are primarily meant to be rendered in a browser and\nviewed by human beings and extracting any kind of structured data from them,\nwhile not impossible, tends to be tricky.\nAnd this puts the IndieWeb in a bit of bind.  The IndieWeb's basic unit of\ncommunication is the post and posts live on websites and websites consist of\nHTML pages and HTML pages, as I've already said, are not structured data\nresources.  So, how does one (programatically) extract a post from a website\nthat one has never visited before?  How does one distinguish notes from\narticles and likes?  These are questions that are readily answered if you're\ndesigning a private, walled social network, because you get to design the\ndata resources from the ground up.  You get to decide what a post looks\nlike, and the web resources involved in modelling one.  It's a lot harder to\ndo when you have to somehow extract that information in a predictable manner\nfrom the chaotic tag soup that forms the majority of personal websites.\nEnter Microformats\nSo what can you do?  What exactly does a post look like on the IndieWeb?\nFinally we come to the answer, and it requires knowledge about a subject\ncalled microformats.\nMicroformats are basically just specialized CSS classes added to your HTML\ncontent in order to give consumers some idea of what that content\nrepresents.  They are effectively the API of the IndieWeb.  Different kinds\nof posts can be represented with different combinations of microformats.\nA standard blog entry (an article, in IndieWeb parlance), might look\nlike this, for example:\n<div class=\"h-entry\">\n    <h1 class=\"p-name\">Awesome Title<h1>\n    <div class=\"e-content\">\n        This is a pretty good blog entry\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n\nThe \"h-entry\" CSS class identifies the whole div as a generic post.\nThe \"p-name\" class identifies the h1 tag as the title of the post and the\n\"e-content\" class represents the article content itself.  We know this is a\nblog entry because of the title; blog entries are really nothing more then\nself-contained, standalone pieces of content with titles.\n(If you're curious about why microformat classes start with a certain\nletter, like h or p, you should read the standard.  The specifics,\nwhile interesting, are not germane to this discussion).\nA note (the IndieWeb equivalent of a tweet) looks more or less the\nsame as an article, but lacks a title:\n<div class=\"h-entry\">\n    <div class=\"e-content\">\n        This is a pretty good note\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n\nIndieWeb reply posts are basically just notes with extra information\nto give the reply some context:\n<div class=\"h-entry\">\n    <a class=\"u-in-reply-to\" href=\"http://elsewhere.com/posts/1234\">\n    <div class=\"e-content\">\n        This is a pretty good reply\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n\nNote the telltale \"u-in-reply-to\" URL, which identifies this post as a\nreply, and points to the post that this reply is about.\nAn IndieWeb like is very similar to an IndieWeb reply, but uses the\n\"u-like-of\" class instead of the \"u-in-reply-to\" class:\n<div class=\"h-entry\">\n    <a class=\"u-like-of\" href=\"http://elsewhere.com/posts/1234\">\n    <div class=\"e-content\">\n        This is a pretty good like\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n\nThough likes can contain content of their own, they often don't, so they can\noften be as simple as this:\n<div class=\"h-entry\">\n    <a class=\"u-like-of\" href=\"http://elsewhere.com/posts/1234\">\n</div>\n\n\n\nFrom Microformats to JSON\nOnce you embed your posts with microformats, how does a 3rd party make use\nof the information?  They do it with a microformat parser.  Microformat\nparsers function by reading the special microformat classes from an HTML\ndocument and producing a canonical JSON representation of the extracted\ndata.  So, for example, this markup:\n<div class=\"h-entry\">\n    <h1 class=\"p-name\">Awesome Title<h1>\n    <div class=\"e-content\">\n        This is a pretty good blog entry\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n\nwill produce this JSON:\n{\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": [\n        \"h-entry\"\n      ],\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"name\": [\n          \"Awesome Title\"\n        ],\n        \"content\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"This is a pretty good blog entry\",\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\naccording to rules defined by the standard.\nBear in mind that any HTML element without an associated microformatted\nclass is effectively ignored by a microformat parser, so a post that looks\nlike this:\n<article class=\"h-entry\">\n    <div class=\"something-weird\">\n        This isn't really part of the content\n    </div>\n    <h1 class=\"p-name\">Awesome Title<h1>\n    <span class=\"wrap\">Something else here</span>\n    <div class=\"e-content\">\n        This is a pretty good blog entry\n    </div>\n    <footer>\n       This is an awesome footer\n    </footer>\n</article>\n\n\n\nwill produce exactly the same JSON as the post above.\nIn other words, microformats are basically a way of embedding structured\ndata into an unstructured HTML page.  Effectively, microformats allow a\nvanilla, free form personal website to double as a RESTful data service.\nI'll say this again, because I think it's kind of cool: microformats\ntransform a plain, vanilla, HTML-based personal website into a RESTful data\nservice.\nI feel like Roy Fielding would be proud.\nCounting Hearts\nThe process of liking a post on the IndieWeb, as I alluded to before, might\nseem like a very one-sided activity.  The liker publishes a special post on\ntheir own site which represents the \"like\" and that's pretty much that.  The\nlikee isn't really involved in the procedure.\nExcept, of course, that if this were actually true, the IndieWeb web\nwouldn't be much of a social network.  So how exactly do you know how many\npeople liked your post?\nThe answer involves a concept called webmentions.  A webmention is a\nway of notifying a website that another website has linked to it in some\nfashion.  The basic operation is as follows:\nBob writes an article which links to an article on Alice's website.\nBob publishes his article, and he (or the software he uses) sends a\n  webmention to an endpoint on Alice's domain, informing her that her\n  article was mentioned in Bob's post.\nAlice's endpoint does something with this information (perhaps recording\n  the fact in a database, for example).\nThe webmention protocol is remarkably spare; the payload basically contains\nnothing but the source URL (doing the mentioning) and the target URL (being\nmentioned).  Notably absent is any sort of information about what kind of\npost is doing the mentioning.  Bob's post could have liked Alice's article,\nor it could have replied to it, or it could have just randomly linked to it;\nthe webmention payload is silent on the subject.\nInformation about the post which sent the webmention must obtained by\nactually reading the post via the source URL, parsing its microformats,\nand confirming that the target URL actually appears somewhere in its\ncontents.  These extra steps function as form of validation; a valid\nwebmention must be backed by a real, published post or it will be\nsummarily rejected.  This step also allows the consumer of the source post\nto classify it according to its microformats.  This is ultimately how one\nimplements things such as like counters and comments on an IndieWeb site.\nHere's My Card\nWebmentions allow a website to know when a person has linked to your post\nand a further check can determine the nature of link (was it a like? A\nreply? A repost?).  Notably missing from the ongoing discussion is a crucial\npiece of the puzzle, namely the identity of the person doing the linking.\nOf course, what we do know is the website that did the linking, and if\nyou've read my previous article on the subject, you know that one's\ndomain is basically one's identity on the IndieWeb, so we're halfway there.\nBut if you've used a service like Twitter, you know that this isn't really\nenough; one's personal domain is akin to one's Twitter handle, and although\nsuch information is crucial, it's usually augmented with things like a name\nand an avatar.  How do you provide things like that on the IndieWeb?\nThe answer, once again, is microformats, but this time it's not an h-entry\non which we'll focus but rather a new class called an h-card.  The\nh-card microformat functions roughly like an online business card; it's way\nof attaching personal information, like your name, email address and photo,\nto your personal domain.  A properly embedded h-card becomes especially\nimportant when you want your personal information to appear correctly in a\ncontext other than your own website - for example, when posting likes and\nreplies that you want displayed on other websites.\nEmbedding an h-card in your posts is not difficult:\n<div class=\"h-entry\">\n    <a class=\"p-author h-card\" href=\"http://example.com\">Joe Bloggs</a>\n    <h1 class=\"p-name\">Awesome Title<h1>\n    <div class=\"e-content\">\n        This is a pretty good blog entry\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n\nAs you might expect, the p-author class tells a consumer who the author of\nthe post is, but it's the h-card class which tells you the format of that\ninformation.  This is a very minimal example, making use of a concept called\nimplied properties, which allows parsers to infer certain pieces of\ndata from the structure of the tags.  The result of parsing the h-card, in\nthis case, will look like this:\n{\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": [\n        \"h-card\"\n      ],\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"name\": [\n          \"Joe Bloggs\"\n        ],\n        \"url\": [\n          \"http://example.com\"\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the url attribute is inferred from the fact that the h-card\nis combined with an anchor tag, and the name attribute is inferred from the\ncontents of the tag.\nYou can choose to be more specific with your h-cards:\n<div class=\"h-entry\">\n    <p class=\"h-card\">\n        <img class=\"u-photo\" src=\"http://example.org/photo.png\" alt=\"\" />\n        <a class=\"p-name u-url\" href=\"http://example.org\">Joe Bloggs</a>\n        <a class=\"u-email\" href=\"mailto:joebloggs@example.com\">joebloggs@example.com</a>, \n    </p>\n    <h1 class=\"p-name\">Awesome Title<h1>\n    <div class=\"e-content\">\n        This is a pretty good blog entry\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n\nThis results in the following parsed h-card:\n{\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": [\n        \"h-card\"\n      ],\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"photo\": [\n          \"http://example.org/photo.png\"\n        ],\n        \"name\": [\n          \"Joe Bloggs\"\n        ],\n        \"url\": [\n          \"http://example.org\"\n        ],\n        \"email\": [\n          \"mailto:joebloggs@example.com\"\n        ],\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\nYou can also choose to maintain a canonical or representative h-card\nwhich represents your homepage.  You do this by:\nAdding an h-card to your homepage\nMaking sure that your homepage h-card contains a u-uid attribute to\n  represent the page itself.\nMy representative h-card on my homepage looks like this, for example:\n<section class=\"h-card\">\n    <ul>\n        <li>\n            <img class=\"u-photo\" src=\"/me02.jpg\"/>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            <a class=\"p-name u-url u-uid\" \n                href=\"https://desmondrivet.com\">Desmond Rivet</a>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            <a class=\"u-email\"\n               href=\"mailto:desmond.rivet@gmail.com\">desmond.rivet@gmail.com</a>\n        </li>\n    </ul>\n</section>\n\n\n\nThis will produce the following parsed JSON:\n{\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": [\n        \"h-card\"\n      ],\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"photo\": [\n          \"http://desmondrivet.com/me02.png\"\n        ],\n        \"name\": [\n          \"Desmond Rivet\"\n        ],\n        \"url\": [\n          \"http://desmondrivet.com\"\n        ],\n        \"uid\": [\n          \"http://desmondrivet.com\"\n        ],\n        \"email\": [\n          \"mailto:desmond.rivet@gmail.com\"\n        ],\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\nOnward!\nAt this point, I think I've covered most of what goes into a basic\nIndieWeb-enabled website.\nThat doesn't mean, of course, that there isn't more to write, but most of\nthe topics from here on out will probably be a bit more specific to my\nsituation.\nFor example, this site is built using Pelican, a static site generator\nbased on Python, and there are a whole batch of issues that crop up\nwhen you try to integrate certain IndieWeb features with that combination.\nI would be remiss if I didn't write about them, but we'll see.\nAnyway, thanks for reading this far!  I hope to see you around!"

It was a terrific success, and I’m sorry I wasn’t able to be there. The topic interests me and is something I’ve thought about on and off for a long time. This morning, I treated myself to thinking about it some more.</p>\n\n<p>I didn’t watch the recording of the session, but I did spend some time going through <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/2020/Pop-ups/GardenAndStream\">the notes</a> and reflecting on bits that caught my attention. I liked <a href=\"https://desmondrivet.com/\">Desmond</a>’s thought that a recipe could be a wiki entry (<a href=\"https://wiki.desmondrivet.com/FindPage?action=fullsearch&amp;advancedsearch=1&amp;and_terms=&amp;or_terms=&amp;not_terms=&amp;mtime=&amp;categories=CategoryRecipes&amp;language=&amp;mimetype=\">Desmond’s recipes</a> are), while a story about a recipe would be a blog post. I agree that the recipe might be tweaked from time to time, maybe to clarify the instructions or add optional deviations. Discovering the deviations, or adapting the recipe, or serving it on a particular occasion, would then be the blog posts. </p>\n<p>On <a href=\"https://fornacalia.com\">my bread and baking site</a>, I don’t revise a recipe once written. If I change or tweak the recipe, that too becomes a blog post that contains a link to the original. Because the site is currently powered by WordPress, it wouldn’t be difficult to convert recipes from posts to pages, but right now I’m not yet seeing enough value in that.</p>\n<p>Either way, though, the problem remains of informing anyone else who looked at the recipe before the changes. Is this on me, the recipe writer, or you, the recipe reader? It would be nice if Desmond could offer an option to subscribe to his recipe category, or to individual recipes. If I bring one of his recipes into my own collection, I would include the source. I could then check it manually or, if I were smarter, build something that automatically compares the current version to the version I originally linked to. My feeling is that it is up to me to keep myself informed about changes, and the best that Desmond could do is make that easier with a feed.</p>\n<h2>Atomicity and Auriculas</h2>\n<p>As a gardener, I am torn between the blowsy attractions of an English herbaceous border in all its glory, and the perfection of a single bloom. It’s a false dichotomy, of course, but the discussion on atomicity brought it to mind.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/twMat\">twMAT</a> noted that TiddlyWiki says that everything should be as small as possible. And yet, a page full of, oh, I dunno, <a href=\"https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/\">68 good thoughts</a> is terrifically absorbing to scroll through. Would I have got to No. 68 if I had to click from one to the next? No. So it is with notes and maybe flowers too. The smallest possible unit makes it easier to take care of each unit, but they really shine in the aggregate.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Auricula theatre displaying three rows of auriculas potted singly\" src=\"https://www.jeremycherfas.net/user/pages/03.blog/a-garden-with-a-water-feature/auricula-theatre.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>This is the principle of the zettelkasten, where each slip, or note, should ideally contain a single idea. The method’s strength is then is to allow those ideas to be chained together in different ways. I’ve not been very good at that, and I acknowledge that I am more of a hoarder than a curator when it comes to my zettelkasten, which only became one after I migrated from nvALT to The Archive a couple of years ago. Too often, when I go through my notes, I discover that I just copied a chunk of someone else’s ideas into my slip, unfiltered, unprocessed, and unlinked to any other thought. </p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the very fact that I am going through my notes reflects a new habit I am trying to build, of setting time aside every week, and sometimes more often, deliberately to tend the oldest notes I have and the notes I created or edited in the past week. Old notes take longer, because I have to check old links and decide what to do if they have rotted away. Those notes also need to be reshaped in line with zettelkasten principles. That means deciding on primary tags, considering internal links, splitting the atoms of long notes and so on. At times it frustrates me, but when it goes well I do see structure emerging and with it new thoughts and new directions to follow.</p>\n<p>Unlike many of the wiki enthusiasts, at least on my reading, I have no interest in making my zettelkasten public, only the things that emerge from it.</p>\n<h2>Stones in the Garden</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://nesslabs.com/\">Anne-Laure Le Cunff</a> raised the point that blogs are set in stone while a wiki consists of evergreen notes. That may be so, in an ideal world, and it prompts two thoughts. First, search engines do a really bad job of indicating the age of any web page. This is especially true for blog posts, and when you are looking to solve a problem it can be a real annoyance. Secondly, the evergreen nature of a wiki means that as it grows it casts bits of itself into the shade; some pages do just get neglected, not by design but by accident.

I built web pages by hand for a newsletter I used to publish physically. The pages had an image-mapped table that let you read past issues. For each new issue, I updated every file, by hand. I often made mistakes. So when I discovered NucleusCMS in 2001 or 2002 I was primed and ready to go. It changed my professional life entirely.
